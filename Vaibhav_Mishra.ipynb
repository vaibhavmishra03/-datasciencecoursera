And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nHow much ye would?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\r\\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\\r\\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nUpon advantage.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do never use it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen Jacob graz\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d his uncle Laban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s sheep,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\\r\\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\\r\\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd what of him? Did he take interest?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\\r\\nDirectly interest; mark what Jacob did.\\r\\nWhen Laban and himself were compromis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThat all the eanlings which were streak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and pied\\r\\nShould fall as Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hire, the ewes being rank\\r\\nIn end of autumn turned to the rams,\\r\\nAnd when the work of generation was\\r\\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\\r\\nThe skilful shepherd pill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me certain wands,\\r\\nAnd in the doing of the deed of kind,\\r\\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\\r\\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\\r\\nFall parti-colour\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d lambs, and those were Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s.\\r\\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\\r\\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for,\\r\\nA thing not in his power to bring to pass,\\r\\nBut sway\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and fashion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by the hand of heaven.\\r\\nWas this inserted to make interest good?\\r\\nOr is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\\r\\nBut note me, signior.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMark you this, Bassanio,\\r\\nThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\\r\\nAn evil soul producing holy witness\\r\\nIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,\\r\\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\\r\\nO, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis a good round sum.\\r\\nThree months from twelve, then let me see the rate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\\r\\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\\r\\nAbout my moneys and my usances.\\r\\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\\r\\n(For suff\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rance is the badge of all our tribe.)\\r\\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\\r\\nAnd spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,\\r\\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\\r\\nWell then, it now appears you need my help.\\r\\nGo to, then, you come to me, and you say\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cShylock, we would have moneys.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d You say so:\\r\\nYou that did void your rheum upon my beard,\\r\\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\\r\\nOver your threshold, moneys is your suit.\\r\\nWhat should I say to you?

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my\\r\\nconscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel\\r\\nme to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run,\\r\\nfiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will run.\\r\\n Enter Old Gobbo with a basket. \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMaster young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than\\r\\nsand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

[Aside.] Mark me now, now will I\\r\\nraise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nNo master, sir, but a poor man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son, his father, though I\\r\\nsay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to\\r\\nlive.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nYour worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s friend, and Launcelet, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nBut I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of\\r\\nyoung Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nOf Launcelet, an\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t please your mastership.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\nErgo, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the\\r\\nyoung gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the\\r\\nSisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you\\r\\nwould say in plain terms, gone to heaven.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMarry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do\\r\\nyou know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my\\r\\nboy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nDo you not know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a\\r\\nwise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of\\r\\nyour son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid\\r\\nlong, a man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son may, but in the end truth will out.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nPray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nPray you, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.\\r\\nI am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI cannot think you are my son.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nI know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man,\\r\\nand I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHer name is Margery, indeed. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou\\r\\nart mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast\\r\\nthou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on\\r\\nhis tail.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt should seem, then, that Dobbin\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tail grows backward. I am sure he had\\r\\nmore hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I\\r\\nhave brought him a present. How \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gree you now?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I\\r\\nwill not rest till I have run some ground. My master\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a very Jew. Give\\r\\nhim a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell\\r\\nevery finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your\\r\\npresent to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve\\r\\nnot him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes\\r\\nthe man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nLeonardo and a follower or two. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYou may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by\\r\\nfive of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and\\r\\ndesire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.\\r\\n [Exit a Servant.] \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo him, father.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nGod bless your worship!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s my son, sir, a poor boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man, that would, sir, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHe hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIndeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHis master and he (saving your worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reverence) are scarce\\r\\ncater-cousins.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause\\r\\nme, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship,\\r\\nand my suit is\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIn very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by\\r\\nthis honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOne speak for both. What would you?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nServe you, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nThat is the very defect of the matter, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI know thee well; thou hast obtain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thy suit.\\r\\nShylock thy master spoke with me this day,\\r\\nAnd hath preferr\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thee, if it be preferment\\r\\nTo leave a rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s service to become\\r\\nThe follower of so poor a gentleman.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThe old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you\\r\\nhave \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe grace of God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, sir, and he hath \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cenough\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st it well. Go, father, with thy son.\\r\\nTake leave of thy old master, and inquire\\r\\nMy lodging out. [To a Servant.] Give him a livery\\r\\nMore guarded than his fellows\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099; see it done.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFather, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a tongue in my head!\\r\\n[Looking on his palm.] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table\\r\\nwhich doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to,\\r\\nhere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a simple line of life. Here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a small trifle of wives, alas,\\r\\nfifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in\\r\\nfor one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life\\r\\nwith the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099scapes. Well, if Fortune\\r\\nbe a woman, she\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a good wench for this gear.

But it is true,\\r\\nwithout any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the\\r\\ngood Antonio, the honest Antonio,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094O that I had a title good enough to\\r\\nkeep his name company!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nCome, the full stop.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHa, what sayest thou?

Rebels it at these years?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThere is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory,\\r\\nmore between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell\\r\\nus, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThere I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show\\r\\nhis head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let\\r\\nhim look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond:\\r\\nhe was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099sy; let him look to his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that\\r\\ngood for?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He\\r\\nhath disgrac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me and hind\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099red me half a million, laugh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at\\r\\nmy losses, mock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,\\r\\ncooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s his reason? I am a\\r\\nJew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,\\r\\naffections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,\\r\\nsubject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by\\r\\nthe same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\\r\\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall\\r\\ngo hard but I will better the instruction.\\r\\n Enter a man from Antonio. \\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you\\r\\nboth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe have been up and down to seek him.\\r\\n Enter Tubal. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, unless the\\r\\ndevil himself turn Jew.\\r\\n [Exeunt Solanio, Salarino\\r\\nand the Servant.] \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHow now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhy there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in\\r\\nFrankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till\\r\\nnow. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would\\r\\nmy daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were\\r\\nhearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And\\r\\nI know not what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s spent in the search. Why, thou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094loss upon loss!\\r\\nThe thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no\\r\\nsatisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshoulders, no sighs but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my breathing, no tears but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshedding.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, what, what?

Is it true, is it true?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThou stick\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore\\r\\nducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nThere came divers of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s creditors in my company to Venice that\\r\\nswear he cannot choose but break.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am very glad of it. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll plague him, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll torture him. I am glad\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nOne of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah\\r\\nwhen I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nBut Antonio is certainly undone.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNay, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s true, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;\\r\\nbespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,\\r\\nfor were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and\\r\\nmeet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano,\\r\\nNerissa and all their trains. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you tarry, pause a day or two\\r\\nBefore you hazard, for in choosing wrong\\r\\nI lose your company; therefore forbear a while.\\r\\nThere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s something tells me (but it is not love)\\r\\nI would not lose you, and you know yourself\\r\\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\\r\\nBut lest you should not understand me well,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nAnd yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nI would detain you here some month or two\\r\\nBefore you venture for me.

Prove it so,\\r\\nLet Fortune go to hell for it, not I.\\r\\nI speak too long, but \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis to peise the time,\\r\\nTo eche it, and to draw it out in length,\\r\\nTo stay you from election.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLet me choose,\\r\\nFor as I am, I live upon the rack.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nUpon the rack, Bassanio!

Good joy, my lord and lady!\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,\\r\\nI wish you all the joy that you can wish;\\r\\nFor I am sure you can wish none from me.\\r\\nAnd when your honours mean to solemnize\\r\\nThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you\\r\\nEven at that time I may be married too.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI thank your lordship, you have got me one.\\r\\nMy eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\\r\\nYou saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.\\r\\nYou lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d; for intermission\\r\\nNo more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\\r\\nYour fortune stood upon the caskets there,\\r\\nAnd so did mine too, as the matter falls.\\r\\nFor wooing here until I sweat again,\\r\\nAnd swearing till my very roof was dry\\r\\nWith oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)\\r\\nI got a promise of this fair one here\\r\\nTo have her love, provided that your fortune\\r\\nAchiev\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d her mistress.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs this true, Nerissa?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nMadam, it is, so you stand pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d withal.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAnd do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYes, faith, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOur feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat! and stake down?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNo, we shall ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er win at that sport and stake down.\\r\\nBut who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?\\r\\nWhat, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and\\r\\nSalerio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,\\r\\nIf that the youth of my new int\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rest here\\r\\nHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\\r\\nI bid my very friends and countrymen,\\r\\nSweet Portia, welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nSo do I, my lord,\\r\\nThey are entirely welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\\r\\nMy purpose was not to have seen you here,\\r\\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\\r\\nHe did entreat me, past all saying nay,\\r\\nTo come with him along.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI did, my lord,\\r\\nAnd I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\\r\\nCommends him to you.\\r\\n [Gives Bassanio a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEre I ope his letter,\\r\\nI pray you tell me how my good friend doth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,\\r\\nNor well, unless in mind. His letter there\\r\\nWill show you his estate.\\r\\n [Bassanio opens the letter.] \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.\\r\\nYour hand, Salerio. What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the news from Venice?\\r\\nHow doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\\r\\nI know he will be glad of our success.\\r\\nWe are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThere are some shrewd contents in yond same paper\\r\\nThat steals the colour from Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cheek.\\r\\nSome dear friend dead, else nothing in the world\\r\\nCould turn so much the constitution\\r\\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?\\r\\nWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,\\r\\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\\r\\nThat this same paper brings you.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nO sweet Portia,\\r\\nHere are a few of the unpleasant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st words\\r\\nThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,\\r\\nWhen I did first impart my love to you,\\r\\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\\r\\nRan in my veins, I was a gentleman.\\r\\nAnd then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\\r\\nRating myself at nothing, you shall see\\r\\nHow much I was a braggart. When I told you\\r\\nMy state was nothing, I should then have told you\\r\\nThat I was worse than nothing; for indeed\\r\\nI have engag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d myself to a dear friend,\\r\\nEngag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d my friend to his mere enemy,\\r\\nTo feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\\r\\nThe paper as the body of my friend,\\r\\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\\r\\nIssuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\\r\\nHath all his ventures fail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, not one hit?\\r\\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\\r\\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\\r\\nAnd not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\\r\\nOf merchant-marring rocks?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot one, my lord.\\r\\nBesides, it should appear, that if he had\\r\\nThe present money to discharge the Jew,\\r\\nHe would not take it. Never did I know\\r\\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\\r\\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\\r\\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\\r\\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\\r\\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\\r\\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\\r\\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\\r\\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\\r\\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\\r\\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\\r\\nThat he would rather have Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh\\r\\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\\r\\nThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,\\r\\nIf law, authority, and power deny not,\\r\\nIt will go hard with poor Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\\r\\nThe best condition\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and unwearied spirit\\r\\nIn doing courtesies, and one in whom\\r\\nThe ancient Roman honour more appears\\r\\nThan any that draws breath in Italy.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor me three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat, no more?\\r\\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond.\\r\\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\\r\\nBefore a friend of this description\\r\\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fault.\\r\\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\\r\\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend.\\r\\nFor never shall you lie by Portia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side\\r\\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\\r\\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over.\\r\\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\\r\\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime,\\r\\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\\r\\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding day.\\r\\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\\r\\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\\r\\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\nSweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my\\r\\nestate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it\\r\\nis impossible I should live, all debts are clear\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d between you and I, if\\r\\nI might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your\\r\\nlove do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nO love, dispatch all business and be gone!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nSince I have your good leave to go away,\\r\\nI will make haste; but, till I come again,\\r\\nNo bed shall e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er be guilty of my stay,\\r\\nNor rest be interposer \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twixt us twain.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and\\r\\nGaoler. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.\\r\\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHear me yet, good Shylock.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.\\r\\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\\r\\nThou call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\\r\\nBut since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\\r\\nThe Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\\r\\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\\r\\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray thee hear me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\\r\\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\\r\\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nIt is the most impenetrable cur\\r\\nThat ever kept with men.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nLet him alone.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\\r\\nHe seeks my life, his reason well I know:\\r\\nI oft deliver\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d from his forfeitures\\r\\nMany that have at times made moan to me.\\r\\nTherefore he hates me.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI am sure the Duke\\r\\nWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThe Duke cannot deny the course of law,\\r\\nFor the commodity that strangers have\\r\\nWith us in Venice, if it be denied,\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill much impeach the justice of the state,\\r\\nSince that the trade and profit of the city\\r\\nConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.\\r\\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\\r\\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\\r\\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\\r\\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\\r\\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,\\r\\nJessica and Balthazar. \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\\r\\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\\r\\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\\r\\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\\r\\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\\r\\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\\r\\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\\r\\nI know you would be prouder of the work\\r\\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI never did repent for doing good,\\r\\nNor shall not now; for in companions\\r\\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\\r\\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\\r\\nThere must be needs a like proportion\\r\\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\\r\\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\\r\\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\\r\\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\\r\\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\\r\\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\\r\\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\\r\\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\\r\\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\\r\\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\\r\\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\\r\\nUntil my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return. For mine own part,\\r\\nI have toward heaven breath\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a secret vow\\r\\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\\r\\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\\r\\nUntil her husband and my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return.\\r\\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\\r\\nAnd there we will abide. I do desire you\\r\\nNot to deny this imposition,\\r\\nThe which my love and some necessity\\r\\nNow lays upon you.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, with all my heart\\r\\nI shall obey you in all fair commands.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nMy people do already know my mind,\\r\\nAnd will acknowledge you and Jessica\\r\\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\\r\\nSo fare you well till we shall meet again.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nFair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI wish your ladyship all heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s content.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI thank you for your wish, and am well pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.\\r\\n [Exeunt Jessica and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nNow, Balthazar,\\r\\nAs I have ever found thee honest-true,\\r\\nSo let me find thee still.

Waste no time in words,\\r\\nBut get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nBALTHAZAR.\\r\\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\\r\\nThat you yet know not of; we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll see our husbands\\r\\nBefore they think of us.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nShall they see us?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\\r\\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\\r\\nWith that we lack. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccover\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnish\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsome\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er thou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath ta\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door.

I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not answer that,\\r\\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d?\\r\\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\\r\\nAnd I be pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to give ten thousand ducats\\r\\nTo have it ban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, are you answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d yet?\\r\\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\\r\\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\\r\\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 the nose,\\r\\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\\r\\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\\r\\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\\r\\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\\r\\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\\r\\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\\r\\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\\r\\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\\r\\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\\r\\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\\r\\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\\r\\nYou may as well do anything most hard\\r\\nAs seek to soften that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than which what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s harder?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nHis Jewish heart.

Shall I say to you\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\\r\\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\\r\\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\\r\\nBe season\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with such viands\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d? You will answer\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe slaves are ours.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d So do I answer you:\\r\\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\\r\\nIs dearly bought; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis mine and I will have it.\\r\\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\\r\\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\\r\\nI stand for judgment.

Bellario greets your Grace.\\r\\n [Presents a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\\r\\nThou mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy knife keen.

I stand here for law.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\\r\\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\\r\\nWhere is he?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHe attendeth here hard by,\\r\\nTo know your answer, whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll admit him.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE OF VENICE.\\r\\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\\r\\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\\r\\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s letter.\\r\\n \\r\\n[Reads.] Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\\r\\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving\\r\\nvisitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\\r\\nHath full relation to the penalty,\\r\\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\\r\\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, his breast\\r\\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNearest his heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d: those are the very words.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\\r\\nThe flesh?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have them ready.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\\r\\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is not so express\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, but what of that?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twere good you do so much for charity.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot find it; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis not in the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou, merchant, have you anything to say?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBut little. I am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and well prepar\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\nGive me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,\\r\\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you,\\r\\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\\r\\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\\r\\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\\r\\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\\r\\nAn age of poverty, from which ling\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring penance\\r\\nOf such misery doth she cut me off.\\r\\nCommend me to your honourable wife,\\r\\nTell her the process of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s end,\\r\\nSay how I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d you, speak me fair in death.\\r\\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\\r\\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\\r\\nRepent but you that you shall lose your friend\\r\\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt.\\r\\nFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAntonio, I am married to a wife\\r\\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself,\\r\\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\\r\\nAre not with me esteem\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d above thy life.\\r\\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\\r\\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that\\r\\nIf she were by to hear you make the offer.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI have a wife who I protest I love.\\r\\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\\r\\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis well you offer it behind her back,\\r\\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThese be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nWould any of the stock of Barabbas\\r\\nHad been her husband, rather than a Christian!\\r\\nWe trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nA pound of that same merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh is thine,\\r\\nThe court awards it and the law doth give it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost rightful judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast.\\r\\nThe law allows it and the court awards it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost learned judge!

Come, prepare.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTarry a little, there is something else.\\r\\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.\\r\\nThe words expressly are \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca pound of flesh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d:\\r\\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\\r\\nBut in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\\r\\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\\r\\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\\r\\nUnto the state of Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs that the law?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThyself shalt see the act.\\r\\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThou shalt have justice more than thou desir\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI take this offer then.

              "'Your cart is currently empty! List of literary distinction Knowledge and enlightenment are sometimes best delivered in nugget-form, which is  why we are suckers for a good essay collection. Hopefully in these collections, our very faves, you’ll be able to detect not only the concentrated nugget-like goodness of each individual essay, but wider, more thought-provoking threads that bind each collection together, whether the subject is societal decay in Mexico or the very nature of reading for pleasure. Oh, and also look out for the incredible takedown of Joan Didion in the Elaine Castillo collection, then read the Joan Didion collection on this list to make your own mind up! \\nElaine Castillo We’re not ones to make lofty claims too often, but this book could permanently change the way you read. In this searing series of essays, Elaine Castillo contemplates and critiques our reading culture (not only with respect to books, but generally how we are encouraged and have learned to ‘read’ the world) and the white supremacy which it champions, ultimately arguing for something ‘better’, a more engaged and thoughtful way of reading stories. She takes to task lauded (and not-so lauded) figures such as J.K Rowling, Joan Didion and Peter Handke, and writes about others with awe, care, and admirable incisiveness. The exhilarating takedowns are not the work of a cultural party-pooper, however. Castillo celebrates as much as she rightly interrogates – even if you haven’t encountered the works she happily valorises, the rigorous approach is infectious, and may lead to you beginning a binge-watch of Wong Kar-wai movies.  \\nHanif Abdurraqib The poet and essayist is fairly peerless when it comes to topics of race and culture in modern America, but where this collection of essays shines brightest is when Abdurraqib’s unbidden enthusiasm for this subjects comes through: so that means Lando Calrissian, the recorded output of Whitney Houston and the power of a good game of spades. Indispensible, angry when necessary, brutally entertaining. \\nJoan Didion Sun-baked showbiz encounters, sensitive and probing explorfations of the darker side of life and lashings of Didion’s trademark incisive analysis. This book simply is Los Angeles, it is America. We particularly enjoyed Didion’s account of hanging around movie sets with a tyre-bellied John Wayne, the sadness and deflation of an icon summed up in one gorgeous essay. \\nFernanda Melchor This collection of reportage and narrative non-fiction is a perfect companion for Melchor’s fiction titles, Hurricane Season and Paradais. The collection contextualises these novels, taking us to the roots of some of Veracruz’s darkest and most dangerous places. In her characteristically frank and non-judgemental style, she shines a light on criminals, murderers and some of Mexico’s most misunderstood people. Whilst no-one is ever excused or let off the hook in Melchor’s stories, she sets out the truths and contexts, politics and histories in such a way that we can take a step back and understand more about the society that created and moulded these individuals.\\xa0 \\nAmina Cain Reaffirming our strong belief that books of the greatest heft and insight more often than not arrive in small and unassuming packages, this sliver of a tome is packed with countless ‘YES, CORRECT!’ moments on every page.  Amina Cain treated us a couple of years ago with her sublime little novel Indelicacy, and to follow she has written this gentle and truthful account of her own reading habits, the books that shaped her own writing sensibilities and the thoughts that race through her mind when in the midst of creativity. It’s like a non-invasive rummage through a very smart friend’s diary.  The good news is that to enjoy this book you need no experience of Cain’s previous work, nor any of the books she refers to. All the pleasure is derived from the nuggets of truth she brings forth from them, the passages she highlights and the way they extend beyond the page and into your own sense of potential.   \\nEmilie Pine One of those books that makes you feel like a different person after you’ve finished it. Notes to Self is a sort of memoir in six raw, personal essays which will make pretty much anyone cry, guaranteed – but in the best, most cathartic way. \\nAlejandro Zambra It’s no secret that we’re Zambra megafans at Storysmith, but once you’ve devoured all his novels we highly suggest migrating to his essay collection, a sort of literary memoir in very short essays by Zambra mostly on the subject of reading – whether it be book recommendations from the man himself or essays about the pleasures of reading photocopies of novels too expensive to buy (apparently books could be prohibitively expensive in the Chile of Zambra’s youth). Dead funny and totally charming. \\nJia Tolentino Tolentino’s gift for entertaining analysis is made all the more readable because she treats subjects like athleisure wear and campus assault with equal seriousness. Sharp yet loose, she careens through hot-button topics with effortless insight and cool. \\nAlexander Chee A thoroughly enjoyable and perceptive collection of semi-autobiographical essays. Chee covers the joys of drag, tongue-in-cheek novel writing tips, odd-jobs between books, activism, the AIDS crisis, sexuality, race, and what it was like to be taught by Annie Dillard.

fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth i had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099shead with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these god defend me from these two\\r\\n \\r\\nnerissa\\r\\nhow say you by the french lord monsieur le bon\\r\\n \\r\\nportia\\r\\ngod made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nneapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he\\r\\nis every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight acap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring\\r\\nhe will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness i shall never requite him\\r\\n \\r\\nnerissa\\r\\nwhat say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england\\r\\n \\r\\nportia\\r\\nyou know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath\\r\\nneither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited i\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in italy his round

a wantwit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself salarino your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings solanio believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad salarino my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechancd would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad salarino why then you are in love antonio fie fie salarino not in love neither then let us say you are sad because you are not

worthier friends had not prevented me antonio your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th occasion to depart salarino good morrow my good lords bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when you grow exceeding strange must it be so salarino well make our leisures to attend on yours exeunt salarino and solanio lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio we two will leave you but at dinnertime i pray you have in mind where we must meet bassanio i will not fail you gratiano you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously changd antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one gratiano let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio i love thee and tis my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressd in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools ill tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion come good lorenzo fare ye well a while ill end my exhortation after dinner lorenzo well we will leave you then till dinnertime i must be one of these same dumb wise men for gratiano never lets me speak gratiano well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue antonio fare you well ill grow a talker for this gear gratiano thanks i faith for silence is only commendable in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible exeunt gratiano and lorenzo antonio is that anything now bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search antonio well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promisd to tell me of bassanio tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridgd from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gagd to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe antonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assurd my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlockd to your occasions bassanio in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first antonio you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalud to catos daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strond and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate antonio thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rackd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake enter portia with her waitingwoman nerissa portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer portia good sentences and well pronouncd nerissa they would be better if well followed portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbd by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come portia i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince portia ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother playd false with a smith nerissa then is there the county palatine portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say and you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight acapring he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and seald under for another nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxonys nephew portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my fathers will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure nerissa do you not remember lady in your fathers time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he calld nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes lookd upon was the best deserving a fair lady portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise enter a servingman how now what news servingman the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door enter bassanio with shylock the jew shylock three thousand ducats well bassanio ay sir for three months shylock for three months well bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound shylock antonio shall become bound well bassanio may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer shylock three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound bassanio your answer to that shylock antonio is a good man bassanio have you heard any imputation to the contrary shylock ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthievesi mean piratesand then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may take his bond bassanio be assured you may shylock i will be assured i may and that i may be assured i will bethink me may i speak with antonio bassanio if it please you to dine with us shylock yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you what news on the rialto who is he comes here enter antonio bassanio this is signior antonio shylock how like a fawning publican he looks i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him he hates our sacred nation and he rails even there where merchants most do congregate on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift which he calls interest cursed be my tribe if i forgive him bassanio shylock do you hear shylock i am debating of my present store and by the near guess of my memory i cannot instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats what of that tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe will furnish me but soft how many months do you desire rest you fair good signior your worship was the last man in our mouths antonio shylock albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving

months you told me so well then your bond and let me see but hear you methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage antonio i do never use it shylock when jacob grazd his uncle labans sheep this jacob from our holy abram was as his wise mother wrought in his behalf the third possessor ay he was the third antonio and what of him did he take interest shylock no not take interest not as you would say directly interest mark what jacob did when laban and himself were compromisd that all the eanlings which were streakd and pied should fall as jacobs hire the ewes being rank in end of autumn turned to the rams and when the work of generation was between these woolly breeders in the act the skilful shepherd pilld me certain wands and in the doing of the deed of kind he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes who then conceiving did in eaning time fall particolourd lambs and those were jacobs this was a way to thrive and he was blest and thrift is blessing if men steal it not antonio this was a venture sir that jacob servd for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams shylock i cannot tell i make it breed as fast but note me signior antonio mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness

you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do youll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have oerlookd me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and

and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of th exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that

still deceivd with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasond with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searchd have livers white as milk and these assume but valours excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchasd by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenst than dost promise aught thy palenness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence portia how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rashembracd despair and shuddring fear and greeneyd jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit bassanio what find i here fair portias counterfeit what demigod hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are severd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh tentrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnishd yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance heres the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleasd with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn to where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise be his or no so thricefair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmd signd ratified by you portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you

blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every

salerio not one my lord besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond jessica when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonios flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him and i know my lord if law authority and power deny not it will go hard with poor antonio portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man the best conditiond and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears than any that draws breath in italy portia what sum owes he the jew bassanio for me three thousand ducats portia what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanios fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never

impenetrable cur that ever kept with men antonio let him alone ill follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliverd from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me salarino i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied twill much impeach the justice of the state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor well gaoler on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and balthazar lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord but if you knew to whom you show this honour how true a gentleman you send relief how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you portia i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lords return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathd a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lords return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you lorenzo madam with all my heart i

time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee balthazar madam i go with all convenient speed portia come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of well see our husbands before they think of us nerissa shall they see us portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack ill hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men ill prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then ill repent and wish for all that that i had not killd them and twenty of these puny lies ill tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school about a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise nerissa why shall we turn to men portia fie what a questions that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come ill tell thee all my whole device

father got you not that you are not the jews daughter jessica that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me launcelet truly then i fear you are damnd both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways jessica i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a christian launcelet truly the more to blame he we were christians enow before een as many as could well live one by another this making of christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money enter lorenzo jessica ill tell my husband launcelet what you say here he comes lorenzo i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelet if you thus get my wife into corners jessica nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelet and i are out he tells me flatly theres no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork lorenzo i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly the moor is with child by you launcelet launcelet it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i took her for lorenzo how every fool can play upon the word i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner launcelet that is done sir they have all stomachs lorenzo goodly lord what a witsnapper are you then bid them prepare dinner launcelet that is done too sir only cover is the word lorenzo will you cover then sir launcelet not so

place garnishd like him that for a tricksy word defy the matter how cheerst thou jessica and now good sweet say thy opinion how dost thou like the lord bassanios wife jessica past all expressing it is very meet the lord bassanio live an upright life for having such a blessing in his lady he finds the joys of heaven here on earth and if on earth he do not merit it in reason he should never come to heaven why if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women and portia one there must be something else pawnd with the other for the poor rude world hath not her fellow lorenzo even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife jessica nay but ask my opinion too of that lorenzo i will anon first let us go to dinner jessica nay let me praise you while i have a stomach lorenzo no pray thee let it serve for tabletalk then howsomeer thou speakst mong other things i shall digest it jessica well ill set you forth enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio gratiano salerio and others duke what is antonio here antonio ready so please your grace duke i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy antonio i have heard your grace hath taen great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envys reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his duke go one and call the jew into the court salarino he is ready at the door he comes my lord enter shylock duke make room and let him stand before our face shylock the world thinks and i think so too that thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act and then tis thought thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty and where thou now exacts the penalty which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture but touchd with human gentleness and love forgive a moiety of the principal glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint from stubborn turks and tartars never traind to offices of tender courtesy we all expect a gentle answer jew shylock i have possessd your grace of what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your citys freedom youll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats ill not answer that but say it is my humour is it answerd what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleasd to give ten thousand ducats to have it band what are you answerd yet some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose cannot contain their urine for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes now for your answer as there is no firm reason to be renderd why he cannot abide a gaping pig why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodgd hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio that i follow thus a losing suit against him are you answered bassanio this is no answer thou unfeeling man to excuse the current of thy cruelty shylock i am not bound to please thee with my answer bassanio do all men kill the things they do not love shylock hates any man the thing he would not kill bassanio every offence is not a hate at first shylock what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice antonio i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften thatthan which whats harder his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no moe offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will bassanio for thy three thousand ducats here is six shylock if every ducat in six thousand ducats were in six parts and every part a ducat i would not draw them i would have my bond duke how shalt thou hope for mercy rendring none shylock what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong you have among you many a purchasd slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them shall i say to you let them be free marry them to your heirs why sweat they under burdens let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasond with such viands you will answer the slaves are ours so do i answer you the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it if you deny me fie upon your law there is no force in the decrees of venice i stand for judgment answer shall i have it duke upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today salarino my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from padua duke bring us the letters call the messenger bassanio good cheer antonio what man courage yet the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood antonio i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph enter nerissa dressed like a lawyers clerk duke came you from padua from bellario nerissa from both my lord bellario greets your grace bassanio why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly shylock to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there gratiano not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou makst thy knife keen but no metal can no not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee shylock no none that thou hast wit enough to make gratiano o be thou damnd inexecrable dog and for thy life let justice be accusd thou almost makst me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam infusd itself in thee for thy desires are wolfish bloody starvd and ravenous shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin i stand here for law duke this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he nerissa he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether youll admit him duke of venice with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place meantime the court shall hear bellarios letter your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthazar i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turnd oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your graces request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation you hear the learnd bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws give me your hand come you from old bellario portia i did my lord duke you are welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court portia i am informed throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew duke antonio and old shylock both stand forth portia is your name shylock shylock shylock is my name portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not antonio ay so he says portia do you confess the bond antonio i do portia then must the jew be merciful shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that portia the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond portia is he not able to discharge the money bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times oer on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will portia it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel o wise young judge how i do honour thee portia i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is portia shylock theres thrice thy money offered thee shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul no not for venice portia why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchants heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond shylock when it is paid according to the tenour it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a welldeserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond antonio most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment portia why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife shylock o noble judge o excellent young man portia for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond shylock tis very true o wise and upright judge how much more elder art thou than thy looks portia therefore lay bare your bosom shylock ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge nearest his heart those are the very words portia it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh shylock i have them ready portia have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death shylock is it so nominated in the bond portia it is not so expressd but what of that twere good you do so much for charity shylock i cannot find it tis not in the bond portia you merchant have you anything to say antonio but little i am armd and well prepard give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingring penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonios end say how i lovd you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough ill pay it instantly with all my heart bassanio antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteemd above thy life i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you portia your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer gratiano i have a wife who i protest i love i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew nerissa tis well you offer it behind her back the wish would make else an unquiet house shylock these be the christian husbands i have a daughter would any of the stock of barabbas had been her husband rather than a christian we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence portia a pound of that same merchants flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it shylock most rightful judge portia and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it shylock most learned judge a sentence come prepare portia tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice gratiano o upright judge mark jew o learned judge shylock is that the law portia thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assurd thou shalt have justice more than thou desirst gratiano o learned judge mark jew a learned judge shylock i take this offer then pay the bond thrice and let the christian go bassanio here is the money portia soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty gratiano o jew an upright judge a learned judge portia therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou takst more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate gratiano a second daniel a daniel jew now infidel i have you on the hip portia why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture shylock give me my principal and let me go bassanio i have it ready for thee here it is portia he hath refusd it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond gratiano a daniel still say i a second daniel i thank thee jew for teaching me that word shylock shall i not have barely my principal portia thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew shylock why then the devil give him good of it ill stay no longer question portia tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offenders life lies in the mercy of the duke only gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou standst for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurrd the danger formerly by me rehearsd down therefore and beg mercy of the duke gratiano beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state thou hast not left the value of a cord therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge duke that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it for half thy wealth it is antonios the other half comes to the general state which humbleness may drive unto a fine portia ay for the state not for antonio shylock nay take my life and all pardon not that you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live portia what mercy can you render him antonio gratiano a halter gratis nothing else for gods sake antonio so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favour he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessd unto his son lorenzo and his daughter duke he shall do this or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here portia art thou contented jew what dost thou say shylock i am content portia clerk draw a deed of gift shylock i pray you give me leave to go from hence i am not well send the deed after me and i will sign it duke get thee gone but do it gratiano in christning shalt thou have two godfathers had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more to bring thee to the gallows not to the font duke sir i entreat you home with me to dinner portia i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth duke i am sorry that your leisure serves you not antonio gratify this gentleman for in my mind you are much bound to him exeunt duke and his train bassanio most worthy gentleman i and my friend have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties in lieu whereof three thousand ducats due unto the jew we freely cope your courteous pains withal antonio and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore portia he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave bassanio dear sir of force i must attempt you further take some remembrance of us as a tribute not as fee grant me two things i pray you not to deny me and to pardon me portia you press me far and therefore i will yield give me your gloves ill wear them for your sake and for your

this house enter lorenzo and jessica lorenzo the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the trojan walls and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night jessica in such a night did thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew and saw the lions shadow ere himself and ran dismayd away lorenzo in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild seabanks and waft her love to come again to carthage jessica in such a night medea gathered the enchanted herbs that did renew old son lorenzo in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont jessica in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well stealing her soul with many vows of faith and neer a true one lorenzo in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her jessica i

bring your music forth into the air how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it enter musicians come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since naught so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not movd with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music enter portia and nerissa portia that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle portia so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nerissa it is your music madam of the house portia nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasond are to their right praise and true perfection peace how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awakd lorenzo that is the voice or i am much deceivd of portia portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice lorenzo dear lady welcome home portia we have been praying for our husbands welfare which speed we hope the better for our words are they returnd lorenzo madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming portia go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you lorenzo your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are no telltales madam fear you not portia this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers bassanio we should hold day with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun portia let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord bassanio i thank you madam give welcome to my friend this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound portia you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you antonio no more than i am well acquitted of portia sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy gratiano by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judges clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart portia a quarrel ho already whats the matter gratiano about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutlers poetry upon a knife love me and leave me not nerissa what talk you of the posy or the value you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave though not for me yet for your vehement oaths you should have been respective and have kept it gave it a judges clerk no gods my judge the clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it gratiano he will and if he live to be a man nerissa ay if a woman live to be a man gratiano now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judges clerk a prating boy that beggd it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him portia you were to blamei must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wifes first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an twere to me i should be mad at it bassanio why i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it gratiano my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that beggd it and indeed deservd it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he beggd mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings portia what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you receivd of me bassanio if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone portia even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will neer come in your bed until i see the ring nerissa nor i in yours till i again see mine bassanio sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when nought would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure portia if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleasd to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe ill die fort but some woman had the ring bassanio no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and beggd the ring the which i did deny him and sufferd him to go displeasd away even he that had held up the very life of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady i was enforcd to send it after him i was beset with shame and courtesy my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it pardon me good lady for by these blessed candles of the night had you been there i think you would have beggd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor portia let not that doctor eer come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you ill not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husbands bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own ill have that doctor for mine bedfellow nerissa and i his clerk therefore be well advisd how you do leave me to mine own protection gratiano well do you so let not me take him then for if i do ill mar the young clerks pen antonio i am th unhappy subject of these quarrels portia sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding bassanio portia forgive me this enforced wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself portia mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and theres an oath of credit bassanio nay but hear me pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee antonio i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husbands ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly portia then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other antonio here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring bassanio by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor portia i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me nerissa and pardon me my gentle gratiano for that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk in lieu of this last night did lie with me gratiano why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough what are we cuckolds ere we have deservd it portia speak not so grossly you are all amazd here is a letter read it at your leisure it comes from padua from bellario there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now returnd i have not yet enterd my house antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbour suddenly you shall not know by what strange accident i chanced on this letter antonio i am dumb bassanio were you the doctor and i knew you not gratiano were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold nerissa ay but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man bassanio sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow when i am absent then lie with my wife antonio sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road portia how now lorenzo my clerk hath some good comforts too for you nerissa ay and ill give them him without a fee there do i give to you and jessica from the rich jew a special deed of gift after his death of all he dies possessd of lorenzo fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starved people portia it is almost morning and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full let us go in and charge us there upon intergatories and we will answer all things faithfully gratiano let it be so the first intergatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day but were the day come i should wish it dark till i were couching with the doctors clerk well while i live ill fear no other thing so sore as keeping

I should be still\\r\\nPlucking the grass to know where sits the wind,\\r\\nPeering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;\\r\\nAnd every object that might make me fear\\r\\nMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\\r\\nWould make me sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nMy wind cooling my broth\\r\\nWould blow me to an ague when I thought\\r\\nWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea.\\r\\nI should not see the sandy hour-glass run\\r\\nBut I should think of shallows and of flats,\\r\\nAnd see my wealthy Andrew dock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in sand,\\r\\nVailing her high top lower than her ribs\\r\\nTo kiss her burial. Should I go to church\\r\\nAnd see the holy edifice of stone\\r\\nAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\\r\\nWhich, touching but my gentle vessel\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side,\\r\\nWould scatter all her spices on the stream,\\r\\nEnrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\\r\\nAnd, in a word, but even now worth this,\\r\\nAnd now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought\\r\\nTo think on this, and shall I lack the thought\\r\\nThat such a thing bechanc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d would make me sad?\\r\\nBut tell not me, I know Antonio\\r\\nIs sad to think upon his merchandise.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBelieve me, no. I thank my fortune for it,\\r\\nMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\\r\\nNor to one place; nor is my whole estate\\r\\nUpon the fortune of this present year.\\r\\nTherefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy then you are in love.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFie, fie!\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nNot in love neither? Then let us say you are sad\\r\\nBecause you are not merry; and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twere as easy\\r\\nFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry\\r\\nBecause you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\\r\\nNature hath fram\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d strange fellows in her time:\\r\\nSome that will evermore peep through their eyes,\\r\\nAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.\\r\\nAnd other of such vinegar aspect\\r\\nThat they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not show their teeth in way of smile\\r\\nThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and\\r\\nGratiano. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\\r\\nGratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.\\r\\nWe leave you now with better company.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI would have stay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d till I had made you merry,\\r\\nIf worthier friends had not prevented me.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYour worth is very dear in my regard.\\r\\nI take it your own business calls on you,\\r\\nAnd you embrace th\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 occasion to depart.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nGood morrow, my good lords.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGood signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?\\r\\nYou grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\\r\\n [Exeunt Salarino and\\r\\nSolanio.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\\r\\nWe two will leave you, but at dinner-time\\r\\nI pray you have in mind where we must meet.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI will not fail you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYou look not well, Signior Antonio,\\r\\nYou have too much respect upon the world.\\r\\nThey lose it that do buy it with much care.\\r\\nBelieve me, you are marvellously chang\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\\r\\nA stage, where every man must play a part,\\r\\nAnd mine a sad one.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nLet me play the fool,\\r\\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\\r\\nAnd let my liver rather heat with wine\\r\\nThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.\\r\\nWhy should a man whose blood is warm within\\r\\nSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\\r\\nSleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom.

If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge.

I shall be there before thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nBALTHAZAR.\\r\\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\\r\\nThat you yet know not of; we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll see our husbands\\r\\nBefore they think of us.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nShall they see us?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\\r\\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\\r\\nWith that we lack. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccover\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnish\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsome\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er thou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath ta\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.\\r\\n Enter Shylock. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nMake room, and let him stand before our face.\\r\\nShylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\\r\\nThat thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice\\r\\nTo the last hour of act, and then, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis thought,\\r\\nThou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange\\r\\nThan is thy strange apparent cruelty;\\r\\nAnd where thou now exacts the penalty,\\r\\nWhich is a pound of this poor merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh,\\r\\nThou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\\r\\nBut, touch\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with human gentleness and love,\\r\\nForgive a moiety of the principal,\\r\\nGlancing an eye of pity on his losses\\r\\nThat have of late so huddled on his back,\\r\\nEnow to press a royal merchant down,\\r\\nAnd pluck commiseration of his state\\r\\nFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\\r\\nFrom stubborn Turks and Tartars never train\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo offices of tender courtesy.\\r\\nWe all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d your Grace of what I purpose,\\r\\nAnd by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\\r\\nTo have the due and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\nIf you deny it, let the danger light\\r\\nUpon your charter and your city\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s freedom!\\r\\nYou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll ask me why I rather choose to have\\r\\nA weight of carrion flesh than to receive\\r\\nThree thousand ducats. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not answer that,\\r\\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d?\\r\\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\\r\\nAnd I be pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to give ten thousand ducats\\r\\nTo have it ban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, are you answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d yet?\\r\\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\\r\\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\\r\\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 the nose,\\r\\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\\r\\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\\r\\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\\r\\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\\r\\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\\r\\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\\r\\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\\r\\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\\r\\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\\r\\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\\r\\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\\r\\nYou may as well do anything most hard\\r\\nAs seek to soften that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than which what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s harder?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nHis Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,\\r\\nMake no moe offers, use no farther means,\\r\\nBut with all brief and plain conveniency.\\r\\nLet me have judgment, and the Jew his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor thy three thousand ducats here is six.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIf every ducat in six thousand ducats\\r\\nWere in six parts, and every part a ducat,\\r\\nI would not draw them, I would have my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nHow shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring none?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\\r\\nYou have among you many a purchas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d slave,\\r\\nWhich, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\\r\\nYou use in abject and in slavish parts,\\r\\nBecause you bought them. Shall I say to you\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\\r\\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\\r\\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\\r\\nBe season\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with such viands\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d? You will answer\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe slaves are ours.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d So do I answer you:\\r\\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\\r\\nIs dearly bought; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis mine and I will have it.\\r\\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\\r\\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\\r\\nI stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nUpon my power I may dismiss this court,\\r\\nUnless Bellario, a learned doctor,\\r\\nWhom I have sent for to determine this,\\r\\nCome here today.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nMy lord, here stays without\\r\\nA messenger with letters from the doctor,\\r\\nNew come from Padua.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nBring us the letters. Call the messenger.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGood cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\\r\\nThe Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\\r\\nEre thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI am a tainted wether of the flock,\\r\\nMeetest for death, the weakest kind of fruit\\r\\nDrops earliest to the ground, and so let me.\\r\\nYou cannot better be employ\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, Bassanio,\\r\\nThan to live still, and write mine epitaph.\\r\\n Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clerk. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nCame you from Padua, from Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFrom both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.\\r\\n [Presents a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\\r\\nThou mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy knife keen. But no metal can,\\r\\nNo, not the hangman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s axe, bear half the keenness\\r\\nOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO, be thou damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, inexecrable dog!\\r\\nAnd for thy life let justice be accus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d;\\r\\nThou almost mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st me waver in my faith,\\r\\nTo hold opinion with Pythagoras\\r\\nThat souls of animals infuse themselves\\r\\nInto the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit\\r\\nGovern\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a wolf who, hang\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for human slaughter,\\r\\nEven from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\\r\\nAnd whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,\\r\\nInfus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d itself in thee; for thy desires\\r\\nAre wolfish, bloody, starv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and ravenous.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\\r\\nThou but offend\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy lungs to speak so loud.\\r\\nRepair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\\r\\nTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\\r\\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\\r\\nWhere is he?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHe attendeth here hard by,\\r\\nTo know your answer, whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll admit him.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE OF VENICE.\\r\\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\\r\\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\\r\\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s letter.\\r\\n \\r\\n[Reads.] Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\\r\\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving\\r\\nvisitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge!

And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nHow much ye would?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\r\\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\\r\\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nUpon advantage.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do never use it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen Jacob graz\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d his uncle Laban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s sheep,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\\r\\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\\r\\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd what of him? Did he take interest?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\\r\\nDirectly interest; mark what Jacob did.\\r\\nWhen Laban and himself were compromis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThat all the eanlings which were streak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and pied\\r\\nShould fall as Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hire, the ewes being rank\\r\\nIn end of autumn turned to the rams,\\r\\nAnd when the work of generation was\\r\\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\\r\\nThe skilful shepherd pill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me certain wands,\\r\\nAnd in the doing of the deed of kind,\\r\\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\\r\\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\\r\\nFall parti-colour\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d lambs, and those were Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s.\\r\\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\\r\\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for,\\r\\nA thing not in his power to bring to pass,\\r\\nBut sway\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and fashion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by the hand of heaven.\\r\\nWas this inserted to make interest good?\\r\\nOr is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\\r\\nBut note me, signior.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMark you this, Bassanio,\\r\\nThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\\r\\nAn evil soul producing holy witness\\r\\nIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,\\r\\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\\r\\nO, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis a good round sum.\\r\\nThree months from twelve, then let me see the rate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\\r\\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\\r\\nAbout my moneys and my usances.\\r\\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\\r\\n(For suff\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rance is the badge of all our tribe.)\\r\\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\\r\\nAnd spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,\\r\\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\\r\\nWell then, it now appears you need my help.\\r\\nGo to, then, you come to me, and you say\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cShylock, we would have moneys.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d You say so:\\r\\nYou that did void your rheum upon my beard,\\r\\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\\r\\nOver your threshold, moneys is your suit.\\r\\nWhat should I say to you?

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my\\r\\nconscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel\\r\\nme to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run,\\r\\nfiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will run.\\r\\n Enter Old Gobbo with a basket. \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMaster young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than\\r\\nsand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

[Aside.] Mark me now, now will I\\r\\nraise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nNo master, sir, but a poor man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son, his father, though I\\r\\nsay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to\\r\\nlive.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nYour worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s friend, and Launcelet, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nBut I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of\\r\\nyoung Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nOf Launcelet, an\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t please your mastership.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\nErgo, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the\\r\\nyoung gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the\\r\\nSisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you\\r\\nwould say in plain terms, gone to heaven.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMarry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do\\r\\nyou know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my\\r\\nboy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nDo you not know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a\\r\\nwise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of\\r\\nyour son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid\\r\\nlong, a man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son may, but in the end truth will out.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nPray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nPray you, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.\\r\\nI am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI cannot think you are my son.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nI know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man,\\r\\nand I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHer name is Margery, indeed. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou\\r\\nart mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast\\r\\nthou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on\\r\\nhis tail.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt should seem, then, that Dobbin\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tail grows backward. I am sure he had\\r\\nmore hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I\\r\\nhave brought him a present. How \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gree you now?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I\\r\\nwill not rest till I have run some ground. My master\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a very Jew. Give\\r\\nhim a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell\\r\\nevery finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your\\r\\npresent to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve\\r\\nnot him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes\\r\\nthe man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nLeonardo and a follower or two. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYou may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by\\r\\nfive of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and\\r\\ndesire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.\\r\\n [Exit a Servant.] \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo him, father.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nGod bless your worship!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s my son, sir, a poor boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man, that would, sir, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHe hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIndeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHis master and he (saving your worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reverence) are scarce\\r\\ncater-cousins.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause\\r\\nme, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship,\\r\\nand my suit is\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIn very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by\\r\\nthis honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOne speak for both. What would you?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nServe you, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nThat is the very defect of the matter, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI know thee well; thou hast obtain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thy suit.\\r\\nShylock thy master spoke with me this day,\\r\\nAnd hath preferr\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thee, if it be preferment\\r\\nTo leave a rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s service to become\\r\\nThe follower of so poor a gentleman.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThe old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you\\r\\nhave \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe grace of God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, sir, and he hath \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cenough\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st it well. Go, father, with thy son.\\r\\nTake leave of thy old master, and inquire\\r\\nMy lodging out. [To a Servant.] Give him a livery\\r\\nMore guarded than his fellows\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099; see it done.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFather, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a tongue in my head!\\r\\n[Looking on his palm.] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table\\r\\nwhich doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to,\\r\\nhere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a simple line of life. Here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a small trifle of wives, alas,\\r\\nfifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in\\r\\nfor one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life\\r\\nwith the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099scapes. Well, if Fortune\\r\\nbe a woman, she\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a good wench for this gear.

But it is true,\\r\\nwithout any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the\\r\\ngood Antonio, the honest Antonio,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094O that I had a title good enough to\\r\\nkeep his name company!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nCome, the full stop.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHa, what sayest thou?

Rebels it at these years?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThere is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory,\\r\\nmore between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell\\r\\nus, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThere I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show\\r\\nhis head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let\\r\\nhim look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond:\\r\\nhe was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099sy; let him look to his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that\\r\\ngood for?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He\\r\\nhath disgrac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me and hind\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099red me half a million, laugh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at\\r\\nmy losses, mock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,\\r\\ncooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s his reason? I am a\\r\\nJew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,\\r\\naffections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,\\r\\nsubject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by\\r\\nthe same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\\r\\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall\\r\\ngo hard but I will better the instruction.\\r\\n Enter a man from Antonio. \\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you\\r\\nboth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe have been up and down to seek him.\\r\\n Enter Tubal. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, unless the\\r\\ndevil himself turn Jew.\\r\\n [Exeunt Solanio, Salarino\\r\\nand the Servant.] \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHow now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhy there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in\\r\\nFrankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till\\r\\nnow. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would\\r\\nmy daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were\\r\\nhearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And\\r\\nI know not what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s spent in the search. Why, thou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094loss upon loss!\\r\\nThe thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no\\r\\nsatisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshoulders, no sighs but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my breathing, no tears but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshedding.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, what, what?

Is it true, is it true?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThou stick\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore\\r\\nducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nThere came divers of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s creditors in my company to Venice that\\r\\nswear he cannot choose but break.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am very glad of it. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll plague him, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll torture him. I am glad\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nOne of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah\\r\\nwhen I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nBut Antonio is certainly undone.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNay, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s true, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;\\r\\nbespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,\\r\\nfor were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and\\r\\nmeet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano,\\r\\nNerissa and all their trains. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you tarry, pause a day or two\\r\\nBefore you hazard, for in choosing wrong\\r\\nI lose your company; therefore forbear a while.\\r\\nThere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s something tells me (but it is not love)\\r\\nI would not lose you, and you know yourself\\r\\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\\r\\nBut lest you should not understand me well,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nAnd yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nI would detain you here some month or two\\r\\nBefore you venture for me.

Prove it so,\\r\\nLet Fortune go to hell for it, not I.\\r\\nI speak too long, but \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis to peise the time,\\r\\nTo eche it, and to draw it out in length,\\r\\nTo stay you from election.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLet me choose,\\r\\nFor as I am, I live upon the rack.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nUpon the rack, Bassanio!

Good joy, my lord and lady!\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,\\r\\nI wish you all the joy that you can wish;\\r\\nFor I am sure you can wish none from me.\\r\\nAnd when your honours mean to solemnize\\r\\nThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you\\r\\nEven at that time I may be married too.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI thank your lordship, you have got me one.\\r\\nMy eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\\r\\nYou saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.\\r\\nYou lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d; for intermission\\r\\nNo more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\\r\\nYour fortune stood upon the caskets there,\\r\\nAnd so did mine too, as the matter falls.\\r\\nFor wooing here until I sweat again,\\r\\nAnd swearing till my very roof was dry\\r\\nWith oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)\\r\\nI got a promise of this fair one here\\r\\nTo have her love, provided that your fortune\\r\\nAchiev\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d her mistress.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs this true, Nerissa?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nMadam, it is, so you stand pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d withal.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAnd do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYes, faith, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOur feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat! and stake down?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNo, we shall ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er win at that sport and stake down.\\r\\nBut who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?\\r\\nWhat, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and\\r\\nSalerio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,\\r\\nIf that the youth of my new int\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rest here\\r\\nHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\\r\\nI bid my very friends and countrymen,\\r\\nSweet Portia, welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nSo do I, my lord,\\r\\nThey are entirely welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\\r\\nMy purpose was not to have seen you here,\\r\\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\\r\\nHe did entreat me, past all saying nay,\\r\\nTo come with him along.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI did, my lord,\\r\\nAnd I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\\r\\nCommends him to you.\\r\\n [Gives Bassanio a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEre I ope his letter,\\r\\nI pray you tell me how my good friend doth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,\\r\\nNor well, unless in mind. His letter there\\r\\nWill show you his estate.\\r\\n [Bassanio opens the letter.] \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.\\r\\nYour hand, Salerio. What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the news from Venice?\\r\\nHow doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\\r\\nI know he will be glad of our success.\\r\\nWe are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThere are some shrewd contents in yond same paper\\r\\nThat steals the colour from Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cheek.\\r\\nSome dear friend dead, else nothing in the world\\r\\nCould turn so much the constitution\\r\\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?\\r\\nWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,\\r\\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\\r\\nThat this same paper brings you.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nO sweet Portia,\\r\\nHere are a few of the unpleasant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st words\\r\\nThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,\\r\\nWhen I did first impart my love to you,\\r\\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\\r\\nRan in my veins, I was a gentleman.\\r\\nAnd then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\\r\\nRating myself at nothing, you shall see\\r\\nHow much I was a braggart. When I told you\\r\\nMy state was nothing, I should then have told you\\r\\nThat I was worse than nothing; for indeed\\r\\nI have engag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d myself to a dear friend,\\r\\nEngag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d my friend to his mere enemy,\\r\\nTo feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\\r\\nThe paper as the body of my friend,\\r\\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\\r\\nIssuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\\r\\nHath all his ventures fail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, not one hit?\\r\\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\\r\\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\\r\\nAnd not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\\r\\nOf merchant-marring rocks?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot one, my lord.\\r\\nBesides, it should appear, that if he had\\r\\nThe present money to discharge the Jew,\\r\\nHe would not take it. Never did I know\\r\\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\\r\\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\\r\\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\\r\\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\\r\\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\\r\\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\\r\\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\\r\\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\\r\\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\\r\\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\\r\\nThat he would rather have Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh\\r\\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\\r\\nThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,\\r\\nIf law, authority, and power deny not,\\r\\nIt will go hard with poor Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\\r\\nThe best condition\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and unwearied spirit\\r\\nIn doing courtesies, and one in whom\\r\\nThe ancient Roman honour more appears\\r\\nThan any that draws breath in Italy.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor me three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat, no more?\\r\\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond.\\r\\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\\r\\nBefore a friend of this description\\r\\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fault.\\r\\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\\r\\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend.\\r\\nFor never shall you lie by Portia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side\\r\\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\\r\\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over.\\r\\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\\r\\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime,\\r\\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\\r\\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding day.\\r\\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\\r\\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\\r\\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\nSweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my\\r\\nestate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it\\r\\nis impossible I should live, all debts are clear\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d between you and I, if\\r\\nI might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your\\r\\nlove do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nO love, dispatch all business and be gone!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nSince I have your good leave to go away,\\r\\nI will make haste; but, till I come again,\\r\\nNo bed shall e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er be guilty of my stay,\\r\\nNor rest be interposer \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twixt us twain.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and\\r\\nGaoler. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.\\r\\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHear me yet, good Shylock.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.\\r\\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\\r\\nThou call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\\r\\nBut since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\\r\\nThe Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\\r\\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\\r\\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray thee hear me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\\r\\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\\r\\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nIt is the most impenetrable cur\\r\\nThat ever kept with men.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nLet him alone.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\\r\\nHe seeks my life, his reason well I know:\\r\\nI oft deliver\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d from his forfeitures\\r\\nMany that have at times made moan to me.\\r\\nTherefore he hates me.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI am sure the Duke\\r\\nWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThe Duke cannot deny the course of law,\\r\\nFor the commodity that strangers have\\r\\nWith us in Venice, if it be denied,\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill much impeach the justice of the state,\\r\\nSince that the trade and profit of the city\\r\\nConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.\\r\\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\\r\\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\\r\\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\\r\\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\\r\\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,\\r\\nJessica and Balthazar. \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\\r\\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\\r\\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\\r\\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\\r\\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\\r\\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\\r\\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\\r\\nI know you would be prouder of the work\\r\\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI never did repent for doing good,\\r\\nNor shall not now; for in companions\\r\\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\\r\\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\\r\\nThere must be needs a like proportion\\r\\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\\r\\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\\r\\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\\r\\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\\r\\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\\r\\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\\r\\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\\r\\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\\r\\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\\r\\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\\r\\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\\r\\nUntil my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return. For mine own part,\\r\\nI have toward heaven breath\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a secret vow\\r\\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\\r\\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\\r\\nUntil her husband and my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return.\\r\\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\\r\\nAnd there we will abide. I do desire you\\r\\nNot to deny this imposition,\\r\\nThe which my love and some necessity\\r\\nNow lays upon you.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, with all my heart\\r\\nI shall obey you in all fair commands.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nMy people do already know my mind,\\r\\nAnd will acknowledge you and Jessica\\r\\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\\r\\nSo fare you well till we shall meet again.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nFair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI wish your ladyship all heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s content.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI thank you for your wish, and am well pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.\\r\\n [Exeunt Jessica and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nNow, Balthazar,\\r\\nAs I have ever found thee honest-true,\\r\\nSo let me find thee still.

Waste no time in words,\\r\\nBut get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nBALTHAZAR.\\r\\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\\r\\nThat you yet know not of; we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll see our husbands\\r\\nBefore they think of us.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nShall they see us?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\\r\\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\\r\\nWith that we lack. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccover\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnish\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsome\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er thou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath ta\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door.

I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not answer that,\\r\\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d?\\r\\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\\r\\nAnd I be pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to give ten thousand ducats\\r\\nTo have it ban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, are you answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d yet?\\r\\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\\r\\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\\r\\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 the nose,\\r\\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\\r\\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\\r\\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\\r\\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\\r\\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\\r\\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\\r\\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\\r\\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\\r\\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\\r\\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\\r\\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\\r\\nYou may as well do anything most hard\\r\\nAs seek to soften that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than which what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s harder?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nHis Jewish heart.

Shall I say to you\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\\r\\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\\r\\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\\r\\nBe season\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with such viands\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d? You will answer\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe slaves are ours.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d So do I answer you:\\r\\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\\r\\nIs dearly bought; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis mine and I will have it.\\r\\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\\r\\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\\r\\nI stand for judgment.

Bellario greets your Grace.\\r\\n [Presents a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\\r\\nThou mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy knife keen.

I stand here for law.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\\r\\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\\r\\nWhere is he?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHe attendeth here hard by,\\r\\nTo know your answer, whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll admit him.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE OF VENICE.\\r\\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\\r\\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\\r\\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s letter.\\r\\n \\r\\n[Reads.] Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\\r\\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving\\r\\nvisitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\\r\\nHath full relation to the penalty,\\r\\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\\r\\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, his breast\\r\\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNearest his heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d: those are the very words.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\\r\\nThe flesh?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have them ready.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\\r\\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is not so express\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, but what of that?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twere good you do so much for charity.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot find it; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis not in the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou, merchant, have you anything to say?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBut little. I am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and well prepar\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\nGive me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,\\r\\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you,\\r\\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\\r\\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\\r\\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\\r\\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\\r\\nAn age of poverty, from which ling\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring penance\\r\\nOf such misery doth she cut me off.\\r\\nCommend me to your honourable wife,\\r\\nTell her the process of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s end,\\r\\nSay how I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d you, speak me fair in death.\\r\\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\\r\\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\\r\\nRepent but you that you shall lose your friend\\r\\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt.\\r\\nFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAntonio, I am married to a wife\\r\\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself,\\r\\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\\r\\nAre not with me esteem\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d above thy life.\\r\\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\\r\\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that\\r\\nIf she were by to hear you make the offer.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI have a wife who I protest I love.\\r\\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\\r\\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis well you offer it behind her back,\\r\\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThese be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nWould any of the stock of Barabbas\\r\\nHad been her husband, rather than a Christian!\\r\\nWe trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nA pound of that same merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh is thine,\\r\\nThe court awards it and the law doth give it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost rightful judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast.\\r\\nThe law allows it and the court awards it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost learned judge!

Come, prepare.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTarry a little, there is something else.\\r\\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.\\r\\nThe words expressly are \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca pound of flesh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d:\\r\\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\\r\\nBut in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\\r\\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\\r\\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\\r\\nUnto the state of Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs that the law?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThyself shalt see the act.\\r\\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThou shalt have justice more than thou desir\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI take this offer then.

Must it be so?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\\r\\n [Exeunt Salarino and\\r\\nSolanio.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\\r\\nWe two will leave you, but at dinner-time\\r\\nI pray you have in mind where we must meet.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI will not fail you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYou look not well, Signior Antonio,\\r\\nYou have too much respect upon the world.\\r\\nThey lose it that do buy it with much care.\\r\\nBelieve me, you are marvellously chang\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\\r\\nA stage, where every man must play a part,\\r\\nAnd mine a sad one.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nLet me play the fool,\\r\\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\\r\\nAnd let my liver rather heat with wine\\r\\nThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.\\r\\nWhy should a man whose blood is warm within\\r\\nSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\\r\\nSleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nHow much ye would?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\r\\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\\r\\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nUpon advantage.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do never use it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen Jacob graz\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d his uncle Laban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s sheep,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\\r\\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\\r\\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd what of him? Did he take interest?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\\r\\nDirectly interest; mark what Jacob did.\\r\\nWhen Laban and himself were compromis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThat all the eanlings which were streak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and pied\\r\\nShould fall as Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hire, the ewes being rank\\r\\nIn end of autumn turned to the rams,\\r\\nAnd when the work of generation was\\r\\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\\r\\nThe skilful shepherd pill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me certain wands,\\r\\nAnd in the doing of the deed of kind,\\r\\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\\r\\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\\r\\nFall parti-colour\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d lambs, and those were Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s.\\r\\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\\r\\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for,\\r\\nA thing not in his power to bring to pass,\\r\\nBut sway\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and fashion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by the hand of heaven.\\r\\nWas this inserted to make interest good?\\r\\nOr is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\\r\\nBut note me, signior.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMark you this, Bassanio,\\r\\nThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\\r\\nAn evil soul producing holy witness\\r\\nIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,\\r\\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\\r\\nO, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis a good round sum.\\r\\nThree months from twelve, then let me see the rate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\\r\\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\\r\\nAbout my moneys and my usances.\\r\\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\\r\\n(For suff\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rance is the badge of all our tribe.)\\r\\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\\r\\nAnd spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,\\r\\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\\r\\nWell then, it now appears you need my help.\\r\\nGo to, then, you come to me, and you say\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cShylock, we would have moneys.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d You say so:\\r\\nYou that did void your rheum upon my beard,\\r\\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\\r\\nOver your threshold, moneys is your suit.\\r\\nWhat should I say to you?

But the full sum of me\\r\\nIs sum of something, which, to term in gross,\\r\\nIs an unlesson\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d girl, unschool\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, unpractis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d;\\r\\nHappy in this, she is not yet so old\\r\\nBut she may learn; happier than this,\\r\\nShe is not bred so dull but she can learn;\\r\\nHappiest of all, is that her gentle spirit\\r\\nCommits itself to yours to be directed,\\r\\nAs from her lord, her governor, her king.\\r\\nMyself, and what is mine, to you and yours\\r\\nIs now converted.

For my part, my lord,\\r\\nMy purpose was not to have seen you here,\\r\\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\\r\\nHe did entreat me, past all saying nay,\\r\\nTo come with him along.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI did, my lord,\\r\\nAnd I have reason for it.

What, worse and worse?\\r\\nWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,\\r\\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\\r\\nThat this same paper brings you.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nO sweet Portia,\\r\\nHere are a few of the unpleasant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st words\\r\\nThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,\\r\\nWhen I did first impart my love to you,\\r\\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\\r\\nRan in my veins, I was a gentleman.\\r\\nAnd then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\\r\\nRating myself at nothing, you shall see\\r\\nHow much I was a braggart. When I told you\\r\\nMy state was nothing, I should then have told you\\r\\nThat I was worse than nothing; for indeed\\r\\nI have engag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d myself to a dear friend,\\r\\nEngag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d my friend to his mere enemy,\\r\\nTo feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\\r\\nThe paper as the body of my friend,\\r\\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\\r\\nIssuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\\r\\nHath all his ventures fail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, not one hit?\\r\\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\\r\\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\\r\\nAnd not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\\r\\nOf merchant-marring rocks?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot one, my lord.\\r\\nBesides, it should appear, that if he had\\r\\nThe present money to discharge the Jew,\\r\\nHe would not take it. Never did I know\\r\\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\\r\\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\\r\\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\\r\\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\\r\\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\\r\\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\\r\\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\\r\\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\\r\\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\\r\\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\\r\\nThat he would rather have Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh\\r\\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\\r\\nThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,\\r\\nIf law, authority, and power deny not,\\r\\nIt will go hard with poor Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\\r\\nThe best condition\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and unwearied spirit\\r\\nIn doing courtesies, and one in whom\\r\\nThe ancient Roman honour more appears\\r\\nThan any that draws breath in Italy.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor me three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat, no more?\\r\\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond.\\r\\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\\r\\nBefore a friend of this description\\r\\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fault.\\r\\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\\r\\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend.\\r\\nFor never shall you lie by Portia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side\\r\\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\\r\\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over.\\r\\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\\r\\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime,\\r\\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\\r\\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding day.\\r\\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\\r\\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\\r\\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\nSweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my\\r\\nestate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it\\r\\nis impossible I should live, all debts are clear\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d between you and I, if\\r\\nI might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your\\r\\nlove do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nO love, dispatch all business and be gone!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nSince I have your good leave to go away,\\r\\nI will make haste; but, till I come again,\\r\\nNo bed shall e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er be guilty of my stay,\\r\\nNor rest be interposer \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twixt us twain.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and\\r\\nGaoler. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.\\r\\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHear me yet, good Shylock.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.\\r\\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\\r\\nThou call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\\r\\nBut since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\\r\\nThe Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\\r\\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\\r\\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray thee hear me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\\r\\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\\r\\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nIt is the most impenetrable cur\\r\\nThat ever kept with men.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nLet him alone.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\\r\\nHe seeks my life, his reason well I know:\\r\\nI oft deliver\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d from his forfeitures\\r\\nMany that have at times made moan to me.\\r\\nTherefore he hates me.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI am sure the Duke\\r\\nWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThe Duke cannot deny the course of law,\\r\\nFor the commodity that strangers have\\r\\nWith us in Venice, if it be denied,\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill much impeach the justice of the state,\\r\\nSince that the trade and profit of the city\\r\\nConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.\\r\\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\\r\\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\\r\\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\\r\\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\\r\\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,\\r\\nJessica and Balthazar. \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\\r\\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\\r\\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\\r\\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\\r\\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\\r\\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\\r\\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\\r\\nI know you would be prouder of the work\\r\\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI never did repent for doing good,\\r\\nNor shall not now; for in companions\\r\\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\\r\\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\\r\\nThere must be needs a like proportion\\r\\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\\r\\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\\r\\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\\r\\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\\r\\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\\r\\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\\r\\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\\r\\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\\r\\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\\r\\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\\r\\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\\r\\nUntil my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return. For mine own part,\\r\\nI have toward heaven breath\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a secret vow\\r\\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\\r\\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\\r\\nUntil her husband and my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return.\\r\\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\\r\\nAnd there we will abide.

I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say.

Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots.

His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\\r\\nHath full relation to the penalty,\\r\\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\\r\\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, his breast\\r\\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNearest his heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d: those are the very words.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\\r\\nThe flesh?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have them ready.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\\r\\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is not so express\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, but what of that?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twere good you do so much for charity.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot find it; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis not in the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou, merchant, have you anything to say?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBut little.

Fare you well,\\r\\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you,\\r\\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\\r\\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\\r\\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\\r\\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\\r\\nAn age of poverty, from which ling\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring penance\\r\\nOf such misery doth she cut me off.\\r\\nCommend me to your honourable wife,\\r\\nTell her the process of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s end,\\r\\nSay how I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d you, speak me fair in death.\\r\\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\\r\\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\\r\\nRepent but you that you shall lose your friend\\r\\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt.\\r\\nFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAntonio, I am married to a wife\\r\\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself,\\r\\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\\r\\nAre not with me esteem\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d above thy life.\\r\\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\\r\\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that\\r\\nIf she were by to hear you make the offer.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI have a wife who I protest I love.\\r\\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\\r\\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis well you offer it behind her back,\\r\\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThese be the Christian husbands!

Give him this,\\r\\nAnd bid him keep it better than the other.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHere, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBy heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,\\r\\nFor by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nAnd pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,\\r\\nFor that same scrubbed boy, the doctor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clerk,\\r\\nIn lieu of this, last night did lie with me.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWhy, this is like the mending of highways\\r\\nIn summer, where the ways are fair enough.\\r\\nWhat, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d it?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nSpeak not so grossly.

Lorenzo here\\r\\nShall witness I set forth as soon as you,\\r\\nAnd even but now return\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. I have not yet\\r\\nEnter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,\\r\\nAnd I have better news in store for you\\r\\nThan you expect: unseal this letter soon.\\r\\nThere you shall find three of your argosies\\r\\nAre richly come to harbour suddenly.\\r\\nYou shall not know by what strange accident\\r\\nI chanced on this letter.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI am dumb.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWere you the doctor, and I knew you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWere you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nAy, but the clerk that never means to do it,\\r\\nUnless he live until he be a man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nSweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.\\r\\nWhen I am absent, then lie with my wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nSweet lady, you have given me life and living;\\r\\nFor here I read for certain that my ships\\r\\nAre safely come to road.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHow now, Lorenzo!\\r\\nMy clerk hath some good comforts too for you.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nAy, and I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll give them him without a fee.\\r\\nThere do I give to you and Jessica,\\r\\nFrom the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,\\r\\nAfter his death, of all he dies possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d of.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nFair ladies, you drop manna in the way\\r\\nOf starved people.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is almost morning,\\r\\nAnd yet I am sure you are not satisfied\\r\\nOf these events at full. Let us go in,\\r\\nAnd charge us there upon inter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gatories,\\r\\nAnd we will answer all things faithfully.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nLet it be so. The first inter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gatory\\r\\nThat my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,\\r\\nWhether till the next night she had rather stay,\\r\\nOr go to bed now, being two hours to day.\\r\\nBut were the day come, I should wish it dark\\r\\nTill I were couching with the doctor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clerk.\\r\\nWell, while I live, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll fear no other thing\\r\\nSo sore as keeping safe Nerissa\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s ring.\\r\\n [Exeunt.]\",\n          \"Conflict and conflict resolution idea Does national humiliation explain why wars break\\u00a0out?

        "Polarity (X-axis: Negative to Positive)\n",
        "\n",
        "All categories except psychology appear in the positive sentiment range, indicating generally optimistic or favorable discussions around these topics.\n",
        "Psychology is positioned at the neutral point (around 0.0), suggesting discussions are neither predominantly positive nor negative.\n",
        "Literature shows the most positive sentiment, followed by culture, technology, and philosophy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Subjectivity (Y-axis: Facts to Opinions)\n",
        "\n",
        "Psychology is positioned at the bottom of the y-axis, indicating discussions are highly fact-based with minimal subjective content.\n",
        "Technology, philosophy, and literature all show moderate to high levels of subjectivity (around 0.5), suggesting a balance of facts and opinions.\n",
        "Culture appears to be positioned furthest to the right but slightly off the visible chart area, potentially indicating the highest subjectivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Category-Specific Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "Psychology is neutral in sentiment and highly fact-based, suggesting scientific and evidence-driven discourse.\n",
        "Literature has the most positive sentiment with moderate subjectivity, indicating favorable discussions that balance appreciation (opinions) with analysis (facts).\n",
        "Technology shows positive sentiment with moderate subjectivity, reflecting a mix of factual reporting and opinion-based commentary.\n",
        "Philosophy shows slightly positive sentiment with moderate subjectivity, consistent with a field that balances logical argumentation with personal interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a clear distinction between psychology (fact-oriented, neutral) and the other disciplines which involve more subjective discussions.\n",
        "Academic and cultural subjects tend toward positive rather than negative sentiment in discussions.\n",
        "Literature appears to generate the most positive discourse among the categories.\n",
        "The categories roughly form two clusters: psychology stands alone as highly objective, while the other four categories share similar moderate subjectivity levels but vary in positivity.\n"

And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nHow much ye would?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\r\\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\\r\\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nUpon advantage.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do never use it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen Jacob graz\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d his uncle Laban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s sheep,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\\r\\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\\r\\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd what of him? Did he take interest?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\\r\\nDirectly interest; mark what Jacob did.\\r\\nWhen Laban and himself were compromis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThat all the eanlings which were streak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and pied\\r\\nShould fall as Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s hire, the ewes being rank\\r\\nIn end of autumn turned to the rams,\\r\\nAnd when the work of generation was\\r\\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\\r\\nThe skilful shepherd pill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me certain wands,\\r\\nAnd in the doing of the deed of kind,\\r\\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\\r\\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\\r\\nFall parti-colour\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d lambs, and those were Jacob\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s.\\r\\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\\r\\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for,\\r\\nA thing not in his power to bring to pass,\\r\\nBut sway\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and fashion\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by the hand of heaven.\\r\\nWas this inserted to make interest good?\\r\\nOr is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\\r\\nBut note me, signior.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMark you this, Bassanio,\\r\\nThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\\r\\nAn evil soul producing holy witness\\r\\nIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,\\r\\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\\r\\nO, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis a good round sum.\\r\\nThree months from twelve, then let me see the rate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\\r\\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\\r\\nAbout my moneys and my usances.\\r\\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\\r\\n(For suff\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rance is the badge of all our tribe.)\\r\\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\\r\\nAnd spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,\\r\\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\\r\\nWell then, it now appears you need my help.\\r\\nGo to, then, you come to me, and you say\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cShylock, we would have moneys.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d You say so:\\r\\nYou that did void your rheum upon my beard,\\r\\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\\r\\nOver your threshold, moneys is your suit.\\r\\nWhat should I say to you?

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my\\r\\nconscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel\\r\\nme to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run,\\r\\nfiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will run.\\r\\n Enter Old Gobbo with a basket. \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMaster young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than\\r\\nsand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

[Aside.] Mark me now, now will I\\r\\nraise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nNo master, sir, but a poor man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son, his father, though I\\r\\nsay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to\\r\\nlive.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nYour worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s friend, and Launcelet, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nBut I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of\\r\\nyoung Master Launcelet?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nOf Launcelet, an\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t please your mastership.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\nErgo, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the\\r\\nyoung gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the\\r\\nSisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you\\r\\nwould say in plain terms, gone to heaven.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nMarry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\n[Aside.] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do\\r\\nyou know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my\\r\\nboy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nDo you not know me, father?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nAlack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a\\r\\nwise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of\\r\\nyour son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid\\r\\nlong, a man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s son may, but in the end truth will out.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nPray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nPray you, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.\\r\\nI am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI cannot think you are my son.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nI know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man,\\r\\nand I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHer name is Margery, indeed. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou\\r\\nart mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast\\r\\nthou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on\\r\\nhis tail.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt should seem, then, that Dobbin\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tail grows backward. I am sure he had\\r\\nmore hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I\\r\\nhave brought him a present. How \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gree you now?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I\\r\\nwill not rest till I have run some ground. My master\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a very Jew. Give\\r\\nhim a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell\\r\\nevery finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your\\r\\npresent to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve\\r\\nnot him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes\\r\\nthe man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nLeonardo and a follower or two. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYou may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by\\r\\nfive of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and\\r\\ndesire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.\\r\\n [Exit a Servant.] \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo him, father.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nGod bless your worship!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s my son, sir, a poor boy.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s man, that would, sir, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHe hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIndeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my\\r\\nfather shall specify.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nHis master and he (saving your worship\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reverence) are scarce\\r\\ncater-cousins.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTo be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause\\r\\nme, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nI have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship,\\r\\nand my suit is\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIn very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by\\r\\nthis honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOne speak for both. What would you?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nServe you, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nThat is the very defect of the matter, sir.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI know thee well; thou hast obtain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thy suit.\\r\\nShylock thy master spoke with me this day,\\r\\nAnd hath preferr\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d thee, if it be preferment\\r\\nTo leave a rich Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s service to become\\r\\nThe follower of so poor a gentleman.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThe old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you\\r\\nhave \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe grace of God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, sir, and he hath \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cenough\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st it well. Go, father, with thy son.\\r\\nTake leave of thy old master, and inquire\\r\\nMy lodging out. [To a Servant.] Give him a livery\\r\\nMore guarded than his fellows\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099; see it done.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFather, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a tongue in my head!\\r\\n[Looking on his palm.] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table\\r\\nwhich doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to,\\r\\nhere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a simple line of life. Here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a small trifle of wives, alas,\\r\\nfifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in\\r\\nfor one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life\\r\\nwith the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099scapes. Well, if Fortune\\r\\nbe a woman, she\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a good wench for this gear.

But it is true,\\r\\nwithout any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the\\r\\ngood Antonio, the honest Antonio,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094O that I had a title good enough to\\r\\nkeep his name company!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nCome, the full stop.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHa, what sayest thou?

Rebels it at these years?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThere is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory,\\r\\nmore between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell\\r\\nus, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThere I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show\\r\\nhis head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let\\r\\nhim look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond:\\r\\nhe was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099sy; let him look to his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that\\r\\ngood for?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He\\r\\nhath disgrac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d me and hind\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099red me half a million, laugh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at\\r\\nmy losses, mock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,\\r\\ncooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s his reason? I am a\\r\\nJew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,\\r\\naffections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,\\r\\nsubject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by\\r\\nthe same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\\r\\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall\\r\\ngo hard but I will better the instruction.\\r\\n Enter a man from Antonio. \\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you\\r\\nboth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe have been up and down to seek him.\\r\\n Enter Tubal. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, unless the\\r\\ndevil himself turn Jew.\\r\\n [Exeunt Solanio, Salarino\\r\\nand the Servant.] \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHow now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhy there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in\\r\\nFrankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till\\r\\nnow. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would\\r\\nmy daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were\\r\\nhearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And\\r\\nI know not what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s spent in the search. Why, thou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094loss upon loss!\\r\\nThe thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no\\r\\nsatisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshoulders, no sighs but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my breathing, no tears but o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 my\\r\\nshedding.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, what, what?

Is it true, is it true?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nI spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThou stick\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore\\r\\nducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nThere came divers of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s creditors in my company to Venice that\\r\\nswear he cannot choose but break.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am very glad of it. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll plague him, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll torture him. I am glad\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nOne of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah\\r\\nwhen I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nBut Antonio is certainly undone.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNay, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s true, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;\\r\\nbespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,\\r\\nfor were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and\\r\\nmeet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano,\\r\\nNerissa and all their trains. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you tarry, pause a day or two\\r\\nBefore you hazard, for in choosing wrong\\r\\nI lose your company; therefore forbear a while.\\r\\nThere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s something tells me (but it is not love)\\r\\nI would not lose you, and you know yourself\\r\\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\\r\\nBut lest you should not understand me well,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nAnd yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nI would detain you here some month or two\\r\\nBefore you venture for me.

Prove it so,\\r\\nLet Fortune go to hell for it, not I.\\r\\nI speak too long, but \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis to peise the time,\\r\\nTo eche it, and to draw it out in length,\\r\\nTo stay you from election.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLet me choose,\\r\\nFor as I am, I live upon the rack.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nUpon the rack, Bassanio!

Good joy, my lord and lady!\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,\\r\\nI wish you all the joy that you can wish;\\r\\nFor I am sure you can wish none from me.\\r\\nAnd when your honours mean to solemnize\\r\\nThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you\\r\\nEven at that time I may be married too.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI thank your lordship, you have got me one.\\r\\nMy eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\\r\\nYou saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.\\r\\nYou lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d; for intermission\\r\\nNo more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\\r\\nYour fortune stood upon the caskets there,\\r\\nAnd so did mine too, as the matter falls.\\r\\nFor wooing here until I sweat again,\\r\\nAnd swearing till my very roof was dry\\r\\nWith oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)\\r\\nI got a promise of this fair one here\\r\\nTo have her love, provided that your fortune\\r\\nAchiev\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d her mistress.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs this true, Nerissa?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nMadam, it is, so you stand pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d withal.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAnd do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYes, faith, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nOur feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat! and stake down?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNo, we shall ne\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er win at that sport and stake down.\\r\\nBut who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?\\r\\nWhat, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and\\r\\nSalerio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nLorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,\\r\\nIf that the youth of my new int\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099rest here\\r\\nHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\\r\\nI bid my very friends and countrymen,\\r\\nSweet Portia, welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nSo do I, my lord,\\r\\nThey are entirely welcome.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\\r\\nMy purpose was not to have seen you here,\\r\\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\\r\\nHe did entreat me, past all saying nay,\\r\\nTo come with him along.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI did, my lord,\\r\\nAnd I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\\r\\nCommends him to you.\\r\\n [Gives Bassanio a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEre I ope his letter,\\r\\nI pray you tell me how my good friend doth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,\\r\\nNor well, unless in mind. His letter there\\r\\nWill show you his estate.\\r\\n [Bassanio opens the letter.] \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.\\r\\nYour hand, Salerio. What\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s the news from Venice?\\r\\nHow doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\\r\\nI know he will be glad of our success.\\r\\nWe are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nI would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThere are some shrewd contents in yond same paper\\r\\nThat steals the colour from Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cheek.\\r\\nSome dear friend dead, else nothing in the world\\r\\nCould turn so much the constitution\\r\\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?\\r\\nWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,\\r\\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\\r\\nThat this same paper brings you.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nO sweet Portia,\\r\\nHere are a few of the unpleasant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st words\\r\\nThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,\\r\\nWhen I did first impart my love to you,\\r\\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\\r\\nRan in my veins, I was a gentleman.\\r\\nAnd then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\\r\\nRating myself at nothing, you shall see\\r\\nHow much I was a braggart. When I told you\\r\\nMy state was nothing, I should then have told you\\r\\nThat I was worse than nothing; for indeed\\r\\nI have engag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d myself to a dear friend,\\r\\nEngag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d my friend to his mere enemy,\\r\\nTo feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\\r\\nThe paper as the body of my friend,\\r\\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\\r\\nIssuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\\r\\nHath all his ventures fail\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, not one hit?\\r\\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\\r\\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\\r\\nAnd not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\\r\\nOf merchant-marring rocks?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALERIO.\\r\\nNot one, my lord.\\r\\nBesides, it should appear, that if he had\\r\\nThe present money to discharge the Jew,\\r\\nHe would not take it. Never did I know\\r\\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\\r\\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\\r\\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\\r\\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\\r\\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\\r\\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\\r\\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\\r\\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\\r\\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\\r\\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\\r\\nThat he would rather have Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh\\r\\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\\r\\nThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,\\r\\nIf law, authority, and power deny not,\\r\\nIt will go hard with poor Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\\r\\nThe best condition\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and unwearied spirit\\r\\nIn doing courtesies, and one in whom\\r\\nThe ancient Roman honour more appears\\r\\nThan any that draws breath in Italy.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor me three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhat, no more?\\r\\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond.\\r\\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\\r\\nBefore a friend of this description\\r\\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s fault.\\r\\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\\r\\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend.\\r\\nFor never shall you lie by Portia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side\\r\\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\\r\\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over.\\r\\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\\r\\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime,\\r\\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\\r\\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding day.\\r\\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\\r\\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\\r\\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\nSweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my\\r\\nestate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it\\r\\nis impossible I should live, all debts are clear\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d between you and I, if\\r\\nI might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your\\r\\nlove do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nO love, dispatch all business and be gone!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nSince I have your good leave to go away,\\r\\nI will make haste; but, till I come again,\\r\\nNo bed shall e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er be guilty of my stay,\\r\\nNor rest be interposer \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twixt us twain.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and\\r\\nGaoler. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.\\r\\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis.\\r\\nGaoler, look to him.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHear me yet, good Shylock.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.\\r\\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\\r\\nThou call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\\r\\nBut since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\\r\\nThe Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\\r\\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\\r\\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray thee hear me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\\r\\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\\r\\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nIt is the most impenetrable cur\\r\\nThat ever kept with men.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nLet him alone.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\\r\\nHe seeks my life, his reason well I know:\\r\\nI oft deliver\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d from his forfeitures\\r\\nMany that have at times made moan to me.\\r\\nTherefore he hates me.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI am sure the Duke\\r\\nWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThe Duke cannot deny the course of law,\\r\\nFor the commodity that strangers have\\r\\nWith us in Venice, if it be denied,\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill much impeach the justice of the state,\\r\\nSince that the trade and profit of the city\\r\\nConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.\\r\\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\\r\\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\\r\\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\\r\\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\\r\\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,\\r\\nJessica and Balthazar. \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\\r\\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\\r\\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\\r\\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\\r\\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\\r\\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\\r\\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\\r\\nI know you would be prouder of the work\\r\\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI never did repent for doing good,\\r\\nNor shall not now; for in companions\\r\\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\\r\\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\\r\\nThere must be needs a like proportion\\r\\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\\r\\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\\r\\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\\r\\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\\r\\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\\r\\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\\r\\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\\r\\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\\r\\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\\r\\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\\r\\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\\r\\nUntil my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return. For mine own part,\\r\\nI have toward heaven breath\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a secret vow\\r\\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\\r\\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\\r\\nUntil her husband and my lord\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s return.\\r\\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\\r\\nAnd there we will abide. I do desire you\\r\\nNot to deny this imposition,\\r\\nThe which my love and some necessity\\r\\nNow lays upon you.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, with all my heart\\r\\nI shall obey you in all fair commands.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nMy people do already know my mind,\\r\\nAnd will acknowledge you and Jessica\\r\\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\\r\\nSo fare you well till we shall meet again.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nFair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI wish your ladyship all heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s content.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI thank you for your wish, and am well pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.\\r\\n [Exeunt Jessica and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nNow, Balthazar,\\r\\nAs I have ever found thee honest-true,\\r\\nSo let me find thee still.

Waste no time in words,\\r\\nBut get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nBALTHAZAR.\\r\\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\\r\\nThat you yet know not of; we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll see our husbands\\r\\nBefore they think of us.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nShall they see us?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\\r\\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\\r\\nWith that we lack. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccover\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnish\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsome\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er thou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath ta\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door.

I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not answer that,\\r\\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d?\\r\\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\\r\\nAnd I be pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to give ten thousand ducats\\r\\nTo have it ban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, are you answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d yet?\\r\\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\\r\\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\\r\\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 the nose,\\r\\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\\r\\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\\r\\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\\r\\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\\r\\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\\r\\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\\r\\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\\r\\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\\r\\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\\r\\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\\r\\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\\r\\nYou may as well do anything most hard\\r\\nAs seek to soften that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than which what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s harder?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nHis Jewish heart.

Shall I say to you\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\\r\\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\\r\\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\\r\\nBe season\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with such viands\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d? You will answer\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe slaves are ours.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d So do I answer you:\\r\\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\\r\\nIs dearly bought; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis mine and I will have it.\\r\\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\\r\\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\\r\\nI stand for judgment.

Bellario greets your Grace.\\r\\n [Presents a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\\r\\nThou mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy knife keen.

I stand here for law.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\\r\\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\\r\\nWhere is he?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHe attendeth here hard by,\\r\\nTo know your answer, whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll admit him.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE OF VENICE.\\r\\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\\r\\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\\r\\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s letter.\\r\\n \\r\\n[Reads.] Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\\r\\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving\\r\\nvisitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\\r\\nHath full relation to the penalty,\\r\\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\\r\\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, his breast\\r\\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNearest his heart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d: those are the very words.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\\r\\nThe flesh?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have them ready.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\\r\\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is not so express\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, but what of that?\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twere good you do so much for charity.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI cannot find it; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis not in the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou, merchant, have you anything to say?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBut little. I am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and well prepar\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\nGive me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,\\r\\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you,\\r\\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\\r\\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\\r\\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\\r\\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\\r\\nAn age of poverty, from which ling\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring penance\\r\\nOf such misery doth she cut me off.\\r\\nCommend me to your honourable wife,\\r\\nTell her the process of Antonio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s end,\\r\\nSay how I lov\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d you, speak me fair in death.\\r\\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\\r\\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\\r\\nRepent but you that you shall lose your friend\\r\\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt.\\r\\nFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAntonio, I am married to a wife\\r\\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself,\\r\\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\\r\\nAre not with me esteem\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d above thy life.\\r\\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\\r\\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that\\r\\nIf she were by to hear you make the offer.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nI have a wife who I protest I love.\\r\\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\\r\\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis well you offer it behind her back,\\r\\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThese be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nWould any of the stock of Barabbas\\r\\nHad been her husband, rather than a Christian!\\r\\nWe trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nA pound of that same merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh is thine,\\r\\nThe court awards it and the law doth give it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost rightful judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast.\\r\\nThe law allows it and the court awards it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMost learned judge!

Come, prepare.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTarry a little, there is something else.\\r\\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.\\r\\nThe words expressly are \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca pound of flesh\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d:\\r\\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\\r\\nBut in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\\r\\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\\r\\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\\r\\nUnto the state of Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs that the law?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThyself shalt see the act.\\r\\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nThou shalt have justice more than thou desir\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI take this offer then.

I should be still\\r\\nPlucking the grass to know where sits the wind,\\r\\nPeering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;\\r\\nAnd every object that might make me fear\\r\\nMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\\r\\nWould make me sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nMy wind cooling my broth\\r\\nWould blow me to an ague when I thought\\r\\nWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea.\\r\\nI should not see the sandy hour-glass run\\r\\nBut I should think of shallows and of flats,\\r\\nAnd see my wealthy Andrew dock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in sand,\\r\\nVailing her high top lower than her ribs\\r\\nTo kiss her burial. Should I go to church\\r\\nAnd see the holy edifice of stone\\r\\nAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\\r\\nWhich, touching but my gentle vessel\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s side,\\r\\nWould scatter all her spices on the stream,\\r\\nEnrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\\r\\nAnd, in a word, but even now worth this,\\r\\nAnd now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought\\r\\nTo think on this, and shall I lack the thought\\r\\nThat such a thing bechanc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d would make me sad?\\r\\nBut tell not me, I know Antonio\\r\\nIs sad to think upon his merchandise.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBelieve me, no. I thank my fortune for it,\\r\\nMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\\r\\nNor to one place; nor is my whole estate\\r\\nUpon the fortune of this present year.\\r\\nTherefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy then you are in love.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFie, fie!\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nNot in love neither? Then let us say you are sad\\r\\nBecause you are not merry; and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099twere as easy\\r\\nFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry\\r\\nBecause you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\\r\\nNature hath fram\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d strange fellows in her time:\\r\\nSome that will evermore peep through their eyes,\\r\\nAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.\\r\\nAnd other of such vinegar aspect\\r\\nThat they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not show their teeth in way of smile\\r\\nThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and\\r\\nGratiano. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\\r\\nGratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.\\r\\nWe leave you now with better company.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI would have stay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d till I had made you merry,\\r\\nIf worthier friends had not prevented me.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYour worth is very dear in my regard.\\r\\nI take it your own business calls on you,\\r\\nAnd you embrace th\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 occasion to depart.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nGood morrow, my good lords.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGood signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?\\r\\nYou grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\\r\\n [Exeunt Salarino and\\r\\nSolanio.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\\r\\nWe two will leave you, but at dinner-time\\r\\nI pray you have in mind where we must meet.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI will not fail you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYou look not well, Signior Antonio,\\r\\nYou have too much respect upon the world.\\r\\nThey lose it that do buy it with much care.\\r\\nBelieve me, you are marvellously chang\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\\r\\nA stage, where every man must play a part,\\r\\nAnd mine a sad one.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nLet me play the fool,\\r\\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\\r\\nAnd let my liver rather heat with wine\\r\\nThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.\\r\\nWhy should a man whose blood is warm within\\r\\nSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\\r\\nSleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dress\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neat\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gag\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlock\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo Cato\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter, Brutus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou know\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rack\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronounc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor men\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cottages princes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cchoose\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lott\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a death\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and seal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094I mean\\r\\npirates\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll break a custom.

If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge.

I shall be there before thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nBALTHAZAR.\\r\\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\\r\\nThat you yet know not of; we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll see our husbands\\r\\nBefore they think of us.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nShall they see us?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\\r\\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\\r\\nWith that we lack. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll hold thee any wager,\\r\\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\\r\\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\\r\\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\\r\\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\\r\\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\\r\\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\\r\\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\\r\\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\\r\\nI could not do withal. Then I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a question\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthere\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negro\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccover\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnish\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsome\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er thou speak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath ta\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.\\r\\n Enter Shylock. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nMake room, and let him stand before our face.\\r\\nShylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\\r\\nThat thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice\\r\\nTo the last hour of act, and then, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis thought,\\r\\nThou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange\\r\\nThan is thy strange apparent cruelty;\\r\\nAnd where thou now exacts the penalty,\\r\\nWhich is a pound of this poor merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s flesh,\\r\\nThou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\\r\\nBut, touch\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with human gentleness and love,\\r\\nForgive a moiety of the principal,\\r\\nGlancing an eye of pity on his losses\\r\\nThat have of late so huddled on his back,\\r\\nEnow to press a royal merchant down,\\r\\nAnd pluck commiseration of his state\\r\\nFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\\r\\nFrom stubborn Turks and Tartars never train\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nTo offices of tender courtesy.\\r\\nWe all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have possess\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d your Grace of what I purpose,\\r\\nAnd by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\\r\\nTo have the due and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\nIf you deny it, let the danger light\\r\\nUpon your charter and your city\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s freedom!\\r\\nYou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll ask me why I rather choose to have\\r\\nA weight of carrion flesh than to receive\\r\\nThree thousand ducats. I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll not answer that,\\r\\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d?\\r\\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\\r\\nAnd I be pleas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d to give ten thousand ducats\\r\\nTo have it ban\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d? What, are you answer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d yet?\\r\\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\\r\\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\\r\\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 the nose,\\r\\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\\r\\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\\r\\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be render\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodg\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\\r\\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\\r\\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\\r\\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\\r\\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\\r\\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\\r\\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\\r\\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\\r\\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\\r\\nYou may as well do anything most hard\\r\\nAs seek to soften that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than which what\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s harder?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094\\r\\nHis Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,\\r\\nMake no moe offers, use no farther means,\\r\\nBut with all brief and plain conveniency.\\r\\nLet me have judgment, and the Jew his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor thy three thousand ducats here is six.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIf every ducat in six thousand ducats\\r\\nWere in six parts, and every part a ducat,\\r\\nI would not draw them, I would have my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nHow shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ring none?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\\r\\nYou have among you many a purchas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d slave,\\r\\nWhich, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\\r\\nYou use in abject and in slavish parts,\\r\\nBecause you bought them. Shall I say to you\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\\r\\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\\r\\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\\r\\nBe season\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d with such viands\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d? You will answer\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe slaves are ours.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d So do I answer you:\\r\\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\\r\\nIs dearly bought; \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis mine and I will have it.\\r\\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\\r\\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\\r\\nI stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nUpon my power I may dismiss this court,\\r\\nUnless Bellario, a learned doctor,\\r\\nWhom I have sent for to determine this,\\r\\nCome here today.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nMy lord, here stays without\\r\\nA messenger with letters from the doctor,\\r\\nNew come from Padua.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nBring us the letters. Call the messenger.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGood cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\\r\\nThe Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\\r\\nEre thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI am a tainted wether of the flock,\\r\\nMeetest for death, the weakest kind of fruit\\r\\nDrops earliest to the ground, and so let me.\\r\\nYou cannot better be employ\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, Bassanio,\\r\\nThan to live still, and write mine epitaph.\\r\\n Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s clerk. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nCame you from Padua, from Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFrom both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.\\r\\n [Presents a letter.] \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\\r\\nThou mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy knife keen. But no metal can,\\r\\nNo, not the hangman\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s axe, bear half the keenness\\r\\nOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNo, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nO, be thou damn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d, inexecrable dog!\\r\\nAnd for thy life let justice be accus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d;\\r\\nThou almost mak\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st me waver in my faith,\\r\\nTo hold opinion with Pythagoras\\r\\nThat souls of animals infuse themselves\\r\\nInto the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit\\r\\nGovern\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d a wolf who, hang\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d for human slaughter,\\r\\nEven from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\\r\\nAnd whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,\\r\\nInfus\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d itself in thee; for thy desires\\r\\nAre wolfish, bloody, starv\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d and ravenous.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\\r\\nThou but offend\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099st thy lungs to speak so loud.\\r\\nRepair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\\r\\nTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\\r\\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\\r\\nWhere is he?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHe attendeth here hard by,\\r\\nTo know your answer, whether you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll admit him.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE OF VENICE.\\r\\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\\r\\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\\r\\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s letter.\\r\\n \\r\\n[Reads.] Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\\r\\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving\\r\\nvisitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGrace\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no\\r\\nimpediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a\\r\\nbody with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial\\r\\nshall better publish his commendation.\\n \\r\\nYou hear the learn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d Bellario what he writes,\\r\\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\\r\\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. \\r\\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI did, my lord.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\\r\\nAre you acquainted with the difference\\r\\nThat holds this present question in the court?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\\r\\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, there\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge!

              " ['\\r\\nTHE DUKE OF VENICE\\r\\nTHE PRINCE OF MOROCCO, suitor to Portia\\r\\nTHE PRINCE OF ARRAGON, suitor to Portia\\r\\nANTONIO, a merchant of Venice\\r\\nBASSANIO, his friend, suitor to Portia\\r\\nGRATIANO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio\\r\\nSOLANIO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio\\r\\nSALARINO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio\\r\\nLORENZO, in love with Jessica\\r\\nSHYLOCK, a rich Jew\\r\\nTUBAL, a Jew, his friend\\r\\nLAUNCELET GOBBO, a clown, servant to Shylock\\r\\nOLD GOBBO, father to Launcelet\\r\\nLEONARDO, servant to Bassanio\\r\\nBALTHAZAR, servant to Portia\\r\\nSTEPHANO, servant to Portia\\r\\nSALERIO, a messenger from Venice\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA, a rich heiress\\r\\nNERISSA, her waiting-woman\\r\\nJESSICA, daughter to Shylock\\r\\n \\r\\nMagnificoes of Venice, Officers of the Court of Justice, a Gaoler, Servants\\r\\nand other Attendants\\r\\n Enter Antonio, Salarino and\\r\\nSolanio. \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIn sooth I know not why I am so sad,\\r\\nIt wearies me, you say it wearies you;\\r\\nBut how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\\r\\nWhat stuff â\\x80\\x99tis made of, whereof it is born,\\r\\nI am to learn.\\r\\nAnd such a want-wit sadness makes of me,\\r\\nThat I have much ado to know myself.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nYour mind is tossing on the ocean,\\r\\nThere where your argosies, with portly sail\\r\\nLike signiors and rich burghers on the flood,\\r\\nOr as it were the pageants of the sea,\\r\\nDo overpeer the petty traffickers\\r\\nThat curtsy to them, do them reverence,\\r\\nAs they fly by them with their woven wings.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nBelieve me, sir, had I such venture forth,\\r\\nThe better part of my affections would\\r\\nBe with my hopes abroad. I should be still\\r\\nPlucking the grass to know where sits the wind,\\r\\nPeering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;\\r\\nAnd every object that might make me fear\\r\\nMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\\r\\nWould make me sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nMy wind cooling my broth\\r\\nWould blow me to an ague when I thought\\r\\nWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea.\\r\\nI should not see the sandy hour-glass run\\r\\nBut I should think of shallows and of flats,\\r\\nAnd see my wealthy Andrew dockâ\\x80\\x99d in sand,\\r\\nVailing her high top lower than her ribs\\r\\nTo kiss her burial. Should I go to church\\r\\nAnd see the holy edifice of stone\\r\\nAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\\r\\nWhich, touching but my gentle vesselâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\r\\nWould scatter all her spices on the stream,\\r\\nEnrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\\r\\nAnd, in a word, but even now worth this,\\r\\nAnd now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought\\r\\nTo think on this, and shall I lack the thought\\r\\nThat such a thing bechancâ\\x80\\x99d would make me sad?\\r\\nBut tell not me, I know Antonio\\r\\nIs sad to think upon his merchandise.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nBelieve me, no. I thank my fortune for it,\\r\\nMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\\r\\nNor to one place; nor is my whole estate\\r\\nUpon the fortune of this present year.\\r\\nTherefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy then you are in love.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFie, fie!\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nNot in love neither? Then let us say you are sad\\r\\nBecause you are not merry; and â\\x80\\x99twere as easy\\r\\nFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry\\r\\nBecause you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\\r\\nNature hath framâ\\x80\\x99d strange fellows in her time:\\r\\nSome that will evermore peep through their eyes,\\r\\nAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.\\r\\nAnd other of such vinegar aspect\\r\\nThat theyâ\\x80\\x99ll not show their teeth in way of smile\\r\\nThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\\r\\n Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and\\r\\nGratiano. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\\r\\nGratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.\\r\\nWe leave you now with better company.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI would have stayâ\\x80\\x99d till I had made you merry,\\r\\nIf worthier friends had not prevented me.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYour worth is very dear in my regard.\\r\\nI take it your own business calls on you,\\r\\nAnd you embrace thâ\\x80\\x99 occasion to depart.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nGood morrow, my good lords.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGood signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?\\r\\nYou grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\\r\\n [Exeunt Salarino and\\r\\nSolanio.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\\r\\nWe two will leave you, but at dinner-time\\r\\nI pray you have in mind where we must meet.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nI will not fail you.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nYou look not well, Signior Antonio,\\r\\nYou have too much respect upon the world.\\r\\nThey lose it that do buy it with much care.\\r\\nBelieve me, you are marvellously changâ\\x80\\x99d.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\\r\\nA stage, where every man must play a part,\\r\\nAnd mine a sad one.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nLet me play the fool,\\r\\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\\r\\nAnd let my liver rather heat with wine\\r\\nThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.\\r\\nWhy should a man whose blood is warm within\\r\\nSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\\r\\nSleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice\\r\\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\\r\\n(I love thee, and â\\x80\\x99tis my love that speaks):\\r\\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\\r\\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\\r\\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\\r\\nWith purpose to be dressâ\\x80\\x99d in an opinion\\r\\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\\r\\nAs who should say, â\\x80\\x9cI am Sir Oracle,\\r\\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\\r\\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\\r\\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\\r\\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\\r\\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell thee more of this another time.\\r\\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\\r\\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\\r\\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll end my exhortation after dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\\r\\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\\r\\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\\r\\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nFare you well. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll grow a talker for this gear.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nThanks, iâ\\x80\\x99 faith, for silence is only commendable\\r\\nIn a neatâ\\x80\\x99s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\\r\\n [Exeunt Gratiano and\\r\\nLorenzo.] \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nIs that anything now?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.\\r\\nHis reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall\\r\\nseek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the\\r\\nsearch.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\\r\\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\\r\\nThat you today promisâ\\x80\\x99d to tell me of?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\\r\\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\\r\\nBy something showing a more swelling port\\r\\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\\r\\nNor do I now make moan to be abridgâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\\r\\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\\r\\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\\r\\nHath left me gagâ\\x80\\x99d. To you, Antonio,\\r\\nI owe the most in money and in love,\\r\\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\\r\\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\\r\\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\\r\\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\\r\\nWithin the eye of honour, be assurâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\\r\\nLie all unlockâ\\x80\\x99d to your occasions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\\r\\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\\r\\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\\r\\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\\r\\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\\r\\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\\r\\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\\r\\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\\r\\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\\r\\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\\r\\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\\r\\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\\r\\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\\r\\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\\r\\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\\r\\nIn making question of my uttermost\\r\\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\\r\\nThen do but say to me what I should do\\r\\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\\r\\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\\r\\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\\r\\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her ',\n",
              "  'eyes\\r\\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\\r\\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervaluâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nTo Catoâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, Brutusâ\\x80\\x99 Portia.\\r\\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\\r\\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\\r\\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\\r\\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\\r\\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchosâ\\x80\\x99 strond,\\r\\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\\r\\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\\r\\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\\r\\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\\r\\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nThou knowâ\\x80\\x99st that all my fortunes are at sea;\\r\\nNeither have I money nor commodity\\r\\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\\r\\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\\r\\nThat shall be rackâ\\x80\\x99d even to the uttermost,\\r\\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\\r\\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\\r\\nWhere money is, and I no question make\\r\\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia with her\\r\\nwaiting-woman Nerissa. \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your\\r\\ngood fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with\\r\\ntoo much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,\\r\\nto be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but\\r\\ncompetency lives longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGood sentences, and well pronouncâ\\x80\\x99d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThey would be better if well followed.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\\r\\nchurches, and poor menâ\\x80\\x99s cottages princesâ\\x80\\x99 palaces. It is a good\\r\\ndivine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\\r\\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The\\r\\nbrain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps oâ\\x80\\x99er a cold\\r\\ndecree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip oâ\\x80\\x99er the meshes of good\\r\\ncounsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a\\r\\nhusband. O me, the word â\\x80\\x9cchooseâ\\x80\\x9d! I may neither choose who I would\\r\\nnor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbâ\\x80\\x99d by\\r\\nthe will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,\\r\\nnor refuse none?\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\\r\\ninspirations. Therefore the lottâ\\x80\\x99ry that he hath devised in these three\\r\\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,\\r\\nwill no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly\\r\\nlove. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely\\r\\nsuitors that are already come?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and\\r\\naccording to my description level at my affection.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nAy, thatâ\\x80\\x99s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and\\r\\nhe makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him\\r\\nhimself. I am much afeard my lady his mother playâ\\x80\\x99d false with a smith.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nThen is there the County Palatine.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say â\\x80\\x9cAnd you will not have me,\\r\\nchoose.â\\x80\\x9d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\\r\\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in\\r\\nhis youth. I had rather be married to a deathâ\\x80\\x99s-head with a bone in his\\r\\nmouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a\\r\\nsin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\\r\\nNeapolitanâ\\x80\\x99s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He\\r\\nis every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-capâ\\x80\\x99ring.\\r\\nHe will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty\\r\\nhusbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to\\r\\nmadness, I shall never requite him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath\\r\\nneither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear\\r\\nthat I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper manâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npicture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I\\r\\nthink he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in\\r\\nGermany, and his behaviour everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of\\r\\nthe Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the\\r\\nFrenchman became his surety, and sealâ\\x80\\x99d under for another.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxonyâ\\x80\\x99s nephew?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon\\r\\nwhen he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he\\r\\nis worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,\\r\\nI hope I shall make shift to go without him.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to\\r\\nperform your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, if you should refuse to accept him.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine\\r\\non the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,\\r\\nI know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to\\r\\na sponge.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me\\r\\nwith their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to\\r\\ntrouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than\\r\\nyour fatherâ\\x80\\x99s imposition, depending on the caskets.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be\\r\\nobtained by the manner of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will. I am glad this parcel of\\r\\nwooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his\\r\\nvery absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nDo you not remember, lady, in your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s time, a Venetian,\\r\\na scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\\r\\nMontferrat?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he callâ\\x80\\x99d.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes lookâ\\x80\\x99d upon,\\r\\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\\r\\n Enter a Servingman. \\r\\nHow now! what news?\\r\\n \\r\\nSERVINGMAN.\\r\\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a\\r\\nforerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince\\r\\nhis master will be here tonight.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four\\r\\nfarewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint\\r\\nand the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\\r\\nCome, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,\\r\\nanother knocks at the door.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Bassanio with\\r\\nShylock the Jew. \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nAy, sir, for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nFor three months, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYour answer to that.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAntonio is a good man.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you\\r\\nunderstand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath\\r\\nan argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\\r\\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other\\r\\nventures ',\n",
              "  'he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;\\r\\nthere be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thievesâ\\x80\\x94I mean\\r\\npiratesâ\\x80\\x94and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBe assured you may.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I\\r\\nspeak with Antonio?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nIf it please you to dine with us.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,\\r\\nconjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\\r\\nwalk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,\\r\\nnor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\\r\\n Enter Antonio. \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nThis is Signior Antonio.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\n[Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!\\r\\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\\r\\nBut more for that in low simplicity\\r\\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\\r\\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\\r\\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\\r\\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\\r\\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\\r\\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\\r\\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\\r\\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\\r\\nIf I forgive him!\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nShylock, do you hear?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am debating of my present store,\\r\\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\\r\\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\\r\\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\\r\\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\\r\\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\\r\\nDo you desire? [To Antonio.] Rest you fair, good signior,\\r\\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\\r\\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll break a custom. [To Bassanio.] Is he yet possessâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nHow much ye would?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd for three months.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\r\\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\\r\\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\\r\\nUpon advantage.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do never use it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen Jacob grazâ\\x80\\x99d his uncle Labanâ\\x80\\x99s sheep,â\\x80\\x94\\r\\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\\r\\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\\r\\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAnd what of him?

Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on\\r\\nhis tail.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt should seem, then, that Dobbinâ\\x80\\x99s tail grows backward. I am sure he had\\r\\nmore hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.\\r\\n \\r\\nGOBBO.\\r\\nLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I\\r\\nhave brought him a present. How â\\x80\\x99gree you now?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nWell, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I\\r\\nwill not rest till I have run some ground. My masterâ\\x80\\x99s a very Jew. Give\\r\\nhim a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell\\r\\nevery finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your\\r\\npresent to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve\\r\\nnot him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes\\r\\nthe man!

But it is true,\\r\\nwithout any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the\\r\\ngood Antonio, the honest Antonio,â\\x80\\x94O that I had a title good enough to\\r\\nkeep his name company!â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nCome, the full stop.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHa, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nI would it might prove the end of his losses.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nLet me say â\\x80\\x9camenâ\\x80\\x9d betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here\\r\\nhe comes in the likeness of a Jew.\\r\\n Enter Shylock. \\r\\nHow now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nYou knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s flight.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she\\r\\nflew withal.\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nAnd Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the\\r\\ncomplexion of them all to leave the dam.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShe is damnâ\\x80\\x99d for it.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s certain, if the devil may be her judge.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy own flesh and blood to rebel!\\r\\n \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nOut upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nThere is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory,\\r\\nmore between your ',\n",

But tell\\r\\nus, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThere I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show\\r\\nhis head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let\\r\\nhim look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond:\\r\\nhe was wont to lend money for a Christian curâ\\x80\\x99sy; let him look to his\\r\\nbond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWhy, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s that\\r\\ngood for?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nTo bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge.

And whatâ\\x80\\x99s his reason? I am a\\r\\nJew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,\\r\\naffections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,\\r\\nsubject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by\\r\\nthe same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not\\r\\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And\\r\\nif you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\\r\\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?\\r\\nRevenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\\r\\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall\\r\\ngo hard but I will better the instruction.\\r\\n Enter a man from Antonio. \\r\\nSERVANT.\\r\\nGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you\\r\\nboth.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nWe have been up and down to seek him.\\r\\n Enter Tubal. \\r\\nSOLANIO.\\r\\nHere comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be matchâ\\x80\\x99d, unless the\\r\\ndevil himself turn Jew.\\r\\n [Exeunt Solanio, Salarino\\r\\nand the Servant.] \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHow now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?

A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in\\r\\nFrankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till\\r\\nnow. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would\\r\\nmy daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were\\r\\nhearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And\\r\\nI know not whatâ\\x80\\x99s spent in the search. Why, thouâ\\x80\\x94loss upon loss!\\r\\nThe thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no\\r\\nsatisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights oâ\\x80\\x99 my\\r\\nshoulders, no sighs but oâ\\x80\\x99 my breathing, no tears but oâ\\x80\\x99 my\\r\\nshedding.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYes, other men have ill luck too.

Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nThou stickâ\\x80\\x99st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore\\r\\nducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nThere came divers of Antonioâ\\x80\\x99s creditors in my company to Venice that\\r\\nswear he cannot choose but break.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI am very glad of it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll plague him, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll torture him. I am glad\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nOne of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah\\r\\nwhen I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\\r\\n \\r\\nTUBAL.\\r\\nBut Antonio is certainly undone.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nNay, thatâ\\x80\\x99s true, thatâ\\x80\\x99s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;\\r\\nbespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,\\r\\nfor were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and\\r\\nmeet me at our synagogue.

So may you miss me.\\r\\nBut if you do, youâ\\x80\\x99ll make me wish a sin,\\r\\nThat I had been forsworn.

Never did I know\\r\\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\\r\\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\\r\\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\\r\\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\\r\\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\\r\\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\\r\\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\\r\\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\\r\\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\\r\\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\\r\\nThat he would rather have Antonioâ\\x80\\x99s flesh\\r\\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\\r\\nThat he did owe him.

Therefore, go.\\r\\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\\r\\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\\r\\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\\r\\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\\r\\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,\\r\\nJessica and Balthazar. \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\\r\\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\\r\\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\\r\\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\\r\\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\\r\\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\\r\\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\\r\\nI know you would be prouder of the work\\r\\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI never did repent for doing good,\\r\\nNor shall not now; for in companions\\r\\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\\r\\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\\r\\nThere must be needs a like proportion\\r\\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\\r\\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\\r\\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\\r\\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\\r\\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\\r\\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\\r\\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\\r\\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\\r\\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\\r\\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\\r\\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\\r\\nUntil my lordâ\\x80\\x99s return. For mine own part,\\r\\nI have toward heaven breathâ\\x80\\x99d a secret vow\\r\\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\\r\\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\\r\\nUntil her husband and my lordâ\\x80\\x99s return.\\r\\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\\r\\nAnd there we will abide.

Then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll repent,\\r\\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not killâ\\x80\\x99d them.\\r\\nAnd twenty of these puny lies Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell,\\r\\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\\r\\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\\r\\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\\r\\nWhich I will practise.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFie, what a questionâ\\x80\\x99s that,\\r\\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\\r\\nBut come, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell thee all my whole device\\r\\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\\r\\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\\r\\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter Launcelet and\\r\\nJessica. \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are t',\n",
              "  'o be laid upon the\\r\\nchildren, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,\\r\\nand so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for\\r\\ntruly I think you are damnâ\\x80\\x99d. There is but one hope in it that can do you\\r\\nany good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the\\r\\nJewâ\\x80\\x99s daughter.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be\\r\\nvisited upon me.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly then I fear you are damnâ\\x80\\x99d both by father and mother; thus when I\\r\\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are\\r\\ngone both ways.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, eâ\\x80\\x99en as many\\r\\nas could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the\\r\\nprice of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a\\r\\nrasher on the coals for money.\\r\\n Enter Lorenzo. \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into\\r\\ncorners!\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly\\r\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jewâ\\x80\\x99s daughter;\\r\\nand he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews\\r\\nto Christians you raise the price of pork.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of\\r\\nthe negroâ\\x80\\x99s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an\\r\\nhonest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will\\r\\nshortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but\\r\\nparrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nThat is done too, sir, only â\\x80\\x9ccoverâ\\x80\\x9d is the word.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nWill you cover, then, sir?\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit\\r\\nin an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to\\r\\nthy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in\\r\\nto dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nLAUNCELET.\\r\\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be\\r\\ncovered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\\r\\nconceits shall govern.\\r\\n [Exit.] \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\\r\\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\\r\\nAn army of good words, and I do know\\r\\nA many fools that stand in better place,\\r\\nGarnishâ\\x80\\x99d like him, that for a tricksy word\\r\\nDefy the matter. How cheerâ\\x80\\x99st thou, Jessica?\\r\\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\\r\\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanioâ\\x80\\x99s wife?\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\\r\\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\\r\\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\\r\\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\\r\\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\\r\\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\\r\\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\\r\\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\\r\\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\\r\\nPawnâ\\x80\\x99d with the other, for the poor rude world\\r\\nHath not her fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nEven such a husband\\r\\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\\r\\n \\r\\nLORENZO.\\r\\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\\r\\nThen howsomeâ\\x80\\x99er thou speakâ\\x80\\x99st, â\\x80\\x99mong other things\\r\\nI shall digest it.\\r\\n \\r\\nJESSICA.\\r\\nWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set you forth.\\r\\n [Exeunt.] Enter the Duke, the\\r\\nMagnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\\r\\nand others. \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nWhat, is Antonio here?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nReady, so please your Grace.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\\r\\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\\r\\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\\r\\nFrom any dram of mercy.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI have heard\\r\\nYour Grace hath taâ\\x80\\x99en great pains to qualify\\r\\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\\r\\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\\r\\nOut of his envyâ\\x80\\x99s reach, I do oppose\\r\\nMy patience to his fury, and am armâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\\r\\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\\r\\n \\r\\nSALARINO.\\r\\nHe is ready at the door.

Now, for your answer:\\r\\nAs there is no firm reason to be renderâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\\r\\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\\r\\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\\r\\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\\r\\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\\r\\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\\r\\nMore than a lodgâ\\x80\\x99d hate and a certain loathing\\r\\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\\r\\nA losing suit against him.

His name is Balthazar. I\\r\\nacquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the\\r\\nmerchant. We turnâ\\x80\\x99d oâ\\x80\\x99er many books together. He is furnished with\\r\\nmy opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I\\r\\ncannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your\\r\\nGraceâ\\x80\\x99s request in my stead.

And which the Jew?\\r\\n \\r\\nDUKE.\\r\\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs your name Shylock?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nShylock is my name.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\\r\\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\\r\\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\\r\\n[To Antonio.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nAy, so he says.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nDo you confess the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nI do.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThe quality of mercy is not strainâ\\x80\\x99d,\\r\\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\\r\\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\r\\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\\r\\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\\r\\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\\r\\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\\r\\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\\r\\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\\r\\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\\r\\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\\r\\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest Godâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\\r\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\r\\nThat in the course of justice none of us\\r\\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\\r\\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\r\\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\\r\\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\\r\\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\\r\\nMust needs give sentence â\\x80\\x99gainst the merchant there.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\\r\\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\\r\\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\\r\\nI will be bound to pay it ten times oâ\\x80\\x99er\\r\\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\\r\\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\\r\\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\\r\\nWrest once the law to your authority.\\r\\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\\r\\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\\r\\nCan alter a decree established;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Twill be recorded for a precedent,\\r\\nAnd many an error by the same example\\r\\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\\r\\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nHere â\\x80\\x99tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nShylock, thereâ\\x80\\x99s thrice thy money offered thee.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\\r\\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\\r\\nNo, not for Venice.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\\r\\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\\r\\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\r\\nNearest the merchantâ\\x80\\x99s heart. Be merciful,\\r\\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\\r\\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\\r\\nYou know the law; your exposition\\r\\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\\r\\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\\r\\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\\r\\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\\r\\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\\r\\nTo give the judgment.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nWhy then, thus it is:\\r\\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\\r\\nHath full relation to the penalty,\\r\\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\\r\\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nAy, his breast\\r\\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNearest his heartâ\\x80\\x9d: those are the very words.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\\r\\nThe flesh?\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nI have them ready.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\\r\\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.\\r\\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nIt is not so expressâ\\x80\\x99d, but what of that?\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Twere good you do so much for charity.\\r\\n \\r\\nSHYLOCK.',\n",

Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nAbout a hoop of gold, a paltry ring\\r\\nThat she did give me, whose posy was\\r\\nFor all the world like cutlersâ\\x80\\x99 poetry\\r\\nUpon a knife, â\\x80\\x9cLove me, and leave me not.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nWhat talk you of the posy, or the value?\\r\\nYou swore to me when I did give it you,\\r\\nThat you would wear it till your hour of death,\\r\\nAnd that it should lie with you in your grave.\\r\\nThough not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,\\r\\nYou should have been respective and have kept it.\\r\\nGave it a judgeâ\\x80\\x99s clerk!

What should I say, sweet lady?\\r\\nI was enforcâ\\x80\\x99d to send it after him.\\r\\nI was beset with shame and courtesy.\\r\\nMy honour would not let ingratitude\\r\\nSo much besmear it.

Watch me like Argus,\\r\\nIf you do not, if I be left alone,\\r\\nNow by mine honour which is yet mine own,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nAnd I his clerk. Therefore be well advisâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nHow you do leave me to mine own protection.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWell, do you so.

I dare be bound again,\\r\\nMy soul upon the forfeit, that your lord\\r\\nWill never more break faith advisedly.\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nThen you shall be his surety. Give him this,\\r\\nAnd bid him keep it better than the other.\\r\\n \\r\\nANTONIO.\\r\\nHere, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.\\r\\n \\r\\nBASSANIO.\\r\\nBy heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,\\r\\nFor by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\\r\\n \\r\\nNERISSA.\\r\\nAnd pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,\\r\\nFor that same scrubbed boy, the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s clerk,\\r\\nIn lieu of this, last night did lie with me.\\r\\n \\r\\nGRATIANO.\\r\\nWhy, this is like the mending of highways\\r\\nIn summer, where the ways are fair enough.\\r\\nWhat, are we cuckolds ere we have deservâ\\x80\\x99d it?\\r\\n \\r\\nPORTIA.\\r\\nSpeak not so grossly.

        "# Sentiment Analysis of Academic Categories\n",
        "\n",
        "This graph represents sentiment trends across five academic disciplines (philosophy, psychology, technology, culture, and literature) over time, showing how sentiment fluctuates between positive, negative, and neutral values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "**Philosophy** → Shows strong sentiment swings, starting neutral, peaking positively (≈0.28) early, dipping negative in periods 4-6, then recovering to positive values. This pattern reflects the discipline's inherent contrasts between optimistic and critical perspectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Psychology** → Begins with the strongest positive peak of all categories (≈0.29), followed by a steady decline into negative territory in the middle periods, with a slight recovery at the end remaining below neutral. This suggests initial enthusiasm followed by more critical or clinical discourse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technology** → Demonstrates the most volatile pattern with frequent crossings of the neutral line, fluctuating between moderate positive peaks (≈0.19) and significant negative dips (≈-0.18). This volatility reflects the mixed sentiments around technological developments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Culture** → Features the most extreme fluctuations, with the highest positive values (≈0.29) and deep negative drops (≈-0.17). The pattern shows two distinct positive-to-negative cycles, suggesting a pendulum effect in cultural discourse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Literature** → Displays frequent sentiment shifts crossing the neutral line multiple times, with the strongest positive spike (≈0.25) in period 3. The final trend moves downward to negative territory, indicating a critical turn in literary discourse.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Comparative Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Volatility**: Culture exhibits the most dramatic sentiment swings, while psychology shows a clearer directional trend from positive to negative.\n",
        "- **Initial Sentiment**: Philosophy, psychology, and culture all begin with positive upticks, while literature and technology start in negative or neutral territory.\n",
        "- **Ending Sentiment**: Only philosophy concludes in clearly positive territory, while psychology, technology, and literature end with negative sentiment.\n",
        "- **Consistency**: None of the disciplines maintain a consistent sentiment direction, reflecting the complex and evolving nature of academic discourse.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Academic disciplines demonstrate distinct sentiment patterns that reflect their epistemological orientations: philosophy's dialectical nature, psychology's shift from positive to clinical perspectives, technology's constant reassessment, culture's dramatic swings between celebration and critique, and literature's frequent oscillation between appreciation and criticism."

        "The graph shows sentiment polarity across different text splitting methods (5, 10, and 20 sections) of what appears to be the same text.\n",
        "The most striking observation is that all three splitting methods (5, 10, and 20 sections) show a completely flat line at exactly the 0.0 sentiment polarity mark.\n",
        "This indicates perfectly neutral sentiment across all sections regardless of how finely the text is divided.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Unusual Sentiment Consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike typical sentiment analysis results which show fluctuations, this graph displays remarkable consistency with exactly zero variation.\n",
        "The 20 Sections line (green) maintains perfect neutrality across all 17.5 sections shown on the x-axis.\n",
        "Similarly, both the 10 Sections (orange) and 5 Sections (blue) lines show identical neutral sentiment values, making them visually indistinguishable from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern is highly unusual for natural language text, which typically contains some sentiment variation.\n",
        "Possible explanations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "The analyzed text may be deliberately written to be emotionally neutral (e.g., technical documentation)\n",
        "There could be an issue with the sentiment analysis methodology or implementation\n",
        "The data might represent a baseline or control condition rather than actual text analysis\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Key Takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "The complete lack of sentiment variation across all three splitting methods suggests either a uniquely neutral text or potential methodological considerations that should be examined before drawing conclusions about the text's emotional content."
